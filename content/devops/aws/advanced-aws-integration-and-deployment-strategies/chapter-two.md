# Chapter 2: Setting Up GitHub Workflow for AWS Integration

## Overview

In this chapter, we'll walk through the process of setting up a GitHub workflow to facilitate seamless integration with AWS services. GitHub workflows enable us to automate various tasks, such as building, testing, and deploying applications to AWS, making the development and deployment process more efficient and reliable.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the GitHub workflow, ensure you have the following in place:

1. A GitHub repository containing your application code.

2. AWS account credentials with sufficient permissions to access the required AWS services.

3. Familiarity with GitHub Actions and YAML syntax.

## Configuring GitHub Workflow

Here's a step-by-step guide to setting up a basic GitHub workflow for AWS integration:

1. **Create `.github/workflows` Directory**: Inside your GitHub repository, create a `.github/workflows` directory if it doesn't already exist.

2. **Create Workflow YAML File**: Within the `.github/workflows` directory, create a new YAML file (e.g., `aws-integration.yml`) to define your workflow.

3. **Define Workflow Trigger**: Specify the events that trigger the workflow, such as pushes to the repository or pull requests.

4. **Set Up AWS Credentials**: Store your AWS credentials securely as GitHub secrets. Avoid hardcoding credentials directly in the workflow YAML.

5. **Install AWS CLI and Dependencies**: If your workflow requires the AWS CLI or other dependencies, install them as part of the workflow.

6. **Define Workflow Steps**: Define the individual steps of your workflow. These steps can include building the application, running tests, and deploying to AWS.

7. **Deploy to AWS**: Utilize AWS CLI commands or other deployment tools to deploy your application to AWS services like EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, or Lambda.

8. **Error Handling and Notifications**: Implement error handling and notifications to alert users in case of failures during the workflow.

## Example Workflow YAML

Here's a simplified example of a GitHub workflow YAML for deploying a Golang application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk:

```yaml
name: AWS Elastic Beanstalk Deployment
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set Up Go
        uses: actions/setup-go@v2
        with:
          go-version: 1.17

      - name: Install AWS CLI
        run: |
          curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
          unzip awscliv2.zip
          sudo ./aws/install

      - name: Configure AWS Credentials
        run: |
          aws configure set aws_access_key_id ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws configure set aws_secret_access_key ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws configure set region us-east-1

      - name: Build and Deploy
        run: |
          go build -o myapp main.go
          aws elasticbeanstalk create-application-version --application-name MyApp --version-label ${{ github.sha }} --source-bundle S3Bucket="my-bucket",S3Key="myapp.zip"
          aws elasticbeanstalk update-environment --environment-name MyEnvironment --version-label ${{ github.sha }}
```

## Conclusion

In this chapter, we learned how to set up a GitHub workflow for AWS integration. By automating the deployment process using GitHub Actions, we can seamlessly deploy applications to AWS, improving development efficiency and ensuring consistent deployments.
