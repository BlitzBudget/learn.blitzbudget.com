# Chapter 18: Configuring Auto Scaling for the Lambda Function

AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that automatically scales based on the number of incoming requests. However, there might be scenarios where you want more control over the scaling behavior of your Lambda function. In this chapter, we will explore how to configure auto scaling for a Lambda function using AWS Lambda Provisioned Concurrency and CloudFormation.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the necessary permissions to create resources in AWS using CloudFormation.

## Step 1: Enable Provisioned Concurrency for the Lambda Function

Provisioned Concurrency allows you to set the number of warm instances for your Lambda function. This helps reduce the cold start latency and ensures consistent performance.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.

2. Navigate to the AWS Lambda service.

3. Click on the Lambda function you want to configure for auto scaling.

4. In the "Concurrency" tab, click "Edit."

5. Enable "Provisioned Concurrency" and set the desired number of provisioned concurrency instances.

6. Click "Save" to enable provisioned concurrency for the Lambda function.

## Step 2: Define Provisioned Concurrency in CloudFormation

To automate the configuration of provisioned concurrency for the Lambda function, we'll include it in a CloudFormation template.

```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Description: 'CloudFormation Template for Configuring Auto Scaling for the Lambda Function'

Resources:
  MyLambdaFunction:
    Type: AWS::Lambda::Function
    Properties:
      FunctionName: MyLambdaFunction
      Runtime: python3.8
      Handler: index.handler
      Role: ARN_OF_YOUR_LAMBDA_EXECUTION_ROLE
      Code:
        ZipFile: |
          def handler(event, context):
              return {
                  'statusCode': 200,
                  'body': 'Hello from Lambda!'
              }
      ProvisionedConcurrencyConfig:
        ProvisionedConcurrentExecutions: 10
```

Replace `ARN_OF_YOUR_LAMBDA_EXECUTION_ROLE` with the actual ARN of the IAM role that grants permission to your Lambda function.

## Step 3: Create the CloudFormation Stack

Save the CloudFormation template to a file (e.g., `lambda-auto-scaling-template.yaml`) and use the AWS CLI to create the stack:

```bash
aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name LambdaAutoScalingStack --template-body file://lambda-auto-scaling-template.yaml
```

## Step 4: Test the Auto Scaling Behavior

With provisioned concurrency enabled and the CloudFormation stack created, you can now test the auto scaling behavior of your Lambda function.

1. Send a series of requests to the Lambda function.

2. Monitor the number of provisioned concurrency instances and the performance of your Lambda function.

## Cleanup

To remove the resources created in this chapter, you can delete the CloudFormation stack using the AWS CLI:

```bash
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name LambdaAutoScalingStack
```

## Conclusion

In this chapter, we configured auto scaling for a Lambda function using AWS Lambda Provisioned Concurrency and CloudFormation. By enabling provisioned concurrency, you can control the number of warm instances for your Lambda function, leading to reduced cold start latency and consistent performance. Automating this configuration with CloudFormation ensures that your Lambda function is ready to handle varying workloads and deliver optimal performance as demand fluctuates.
