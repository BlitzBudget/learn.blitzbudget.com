Chapter 15: Integrating API Gateway with Route 53 using AWS CloudFormation

Integrating API Gateway with Route 53 allows you to create custom domain names for your APIs and map them to API Gateway endpoints easily. With AWS CloudFormation, you can automate the process of setting up this integration, making it efficient and scalable. In this chapter, we'll explore how to integrate API Gateway with Route 53 using AWS CloudFormation.

1. **Understanding API Gateway and Route 53 Integration**:

Route 53 is a highly scalable domain name system (DNS) web service provided by AWS. It allows you to register domain names, route traffic to resources, and perform health checks to ensure high availability. When you integrate API Gateway with Route 53, you can map custom domain names (e.g., api.example.com) to your API Gateway endpoints, providing a more user-friendly experience for consumers of your API.

2. **Creating a Custom Domain Name for API Gateway**:

Before integrating API Gateway with Route 53, you must first create a custom domain name in API Gateway. This is achieved using the `AWS::ApiGateway::DomainName` resource type in AWS CloudFormation. Below is an example of how to define the custom domain name resource in your CloudFormation template:

```yaml
ApiGatewayCustomDomain:
  Type: AWS::ApiGateway::DomainName
  Properties:
    DomainName: !Ref DomainName
    CertificateArn: !Ref CertificateArn
    EndpointConfiguration:
      Types:
        - EDGE
    SecurityPolicy: TLS_1_2
    Tags:
      - Key: environment
        Value: production
      - Key: purpose
        Value: api-custom-domain
```

In this CloudFormation resource definition, we specify the `DomainName` property with the desired custom domain name (e.g., api.example.com). The `CertificateArn` property refers to the ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the SSL certificate we generated earlier, which secures the custom domain.

3. **Mapping the Custom Domain to API Gateway**:

After creating the custom domain name, the next step is to map it to the API Gateway endpoint. This is achieved using the `AWS::ApiGateway::BasePathMapping` resource type in AWS CloudFormation. Below is an example of how to define the base path mapping resource in your CloudFormation template:

```yaml
ApiGatewayMapping:
  Type: AWS::ApiGateway::BasePathMapping
  Properties:
    DomainName: !Ref DomainName
    RestApiId: !Ref ApiGatewayRestApi
    Stage: !Ref ApiGatewayStage
```

In this CloudFormation resource definition, we specify the `DomainName` property with the custom domain name we created earlier. The `RestApiId` property is set to the reference of the API Gateway REST API resource, and the `Stage` property is set to the reference of the API Gateway stage resource.

4. **Route 53 DNS Record Set**:

Now that the custom domain is mapped to the API Gateway endpoint, we need to create a DNS record set in Route 53 to route traffic to the API. This is achieved using the `AWS::Route53::RecordSet` resource type in AWS CloudFormation. Below is an example of how to define the DNS record set resource in your CloudFormation template:

```yaml
ApiGatewayDomainARecordSet:
  Type: AWS::Route53::RecordSet
  Properties:
    HostedZoneId: !Ref HostedZoneId
    Name: !Ref DomainName
    Type: A
    AliasTarget:
      DNSName: !GetAtt ApiGatewayCustomDomain.DistributionDomainName
      HostedZoneId: !GetAtt ApiGatewayCustomDomain.DistributionHostedZoneId
```

In this CloudFormation resource definition, we specify the `HostedZoneId` property with the Route 53 hosted zone ID where the domain is registered. The `Name` property is set to the custom domain name, and the `Type` property is set to "A" for an A record. We use the `AliasTarget` property to point the DNS record to the API Gateway custom domain distribution.

5. **Benefits of API Gateway and Route 53 Integration**:

- Custom Domain Names: API consumers can access your API using a user-friendly custom domain name, enhancing the user experience.
- Scalability: Both API Gateway and Route 53 are highly scalable services, ensuring your API can handle varying levels of traffic.
- Simplified DNS Management: Integrating with Route 53 allows you to manage DNS records and route traffic efficiently.

Integrating API Gateway with Route 53 using AWS CloudFormation simplifies the process of setting up custom domain names for your APIs. This integration enhances the accessibility of your API and contributes to a seamless user experience for consumers.
