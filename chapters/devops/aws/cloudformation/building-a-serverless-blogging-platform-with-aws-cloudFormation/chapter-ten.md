#Chapter 10: Implementing API Key Authentication with AWS CloudFormation

API Key authentication is an essential mechanism to secure access to APIs and control usage. It allows API owners to distribute unique API keys to clients, granting them permission to access the API. In this chapter, we will explore how to implement API Key authentication for our API Gateway using AWS CloudFormation.

1. **Understanding API Key Authentication**:

API Key authentication provides a simple and effective way to control access to APIs. Each client receives a unique API key, which they must include in their API requests. API Gateway validates the API key and authorizes the request based on the associated permissions.

2. **Setting up API Key Authentication in AWS CloudFormation**:

To implement API Key authentication, we need to create an API key and associate it with the API Gateway resource in our CloudFormation template. Below is the CloudFormation resource definition for the API key:

```yaml
ApiGatewayApiKey:
  Type: AWS::ApiGateway::ApiKey
  DependsOn: 
    - ApiGatewayUsagePlan
    - ApiGatewayDeployment
    - ApiGatewayStage
  Properties:
    Name: MyApiKey
    Description: API Key for authentication
    Enabled: true
    GenerateDistinctId: true
    StageKeys:
      - RestApiId: !Ref ApiGatewayRestApi
        StageName: !Ref ApiGatewayStage
```

In the above CloudFormation resource definition, we create an API key named "MyApiKey" with a description indicating its purpose for authentication. We enable the API key and set `GenerateDistinctId` to true to ensure each client receives a unique key. The `StageKeys` property associates the API key with the specific API Gateway stage.

3. **Securing API Gateway with API Key Authentication**:

To enforce API Key authentication on the API Gateway methods, we need to update the method definitions. Below is an example of how to configure API Key authentication for the "POST/blog" and "POST/learn" methods:

```yaml
ApiGatewayMethodBlog:
  Type: AWS::ApiGateway::Method
  DependsOn: 
    - ApiGatewayResourceBlog
    - LambdaFunctionBlog
  Properties:
    RestApiId: !Ref ApiGatewayRestApi
    ResourceId: !Ref ApiGatewayResourceBlog
    HttpMethod: POST
    AuthorizationType: API_KEY
    ApiKeyRequired: true
    Integration:
      Type: AWS_PROXY
      IntegrationHttpMethod: POST
      Uri: !Sub
        - arn:aws:apigateway:${AWS::Region}:lambda:path/2015-03-31/functions/${LambdaFunctionBlog.Arn}/invocations
        - LambdaFunctionBlog: !Ref LambdaFunctionBlog
    RequestParameters:
      method.request.header.Authorization: true
    MethodResponses:
      - StatusCode: 200
        ResponseParameters:
          method.response.header.Access-Control-Allow-Origin: "'*'"

ApiGatewayMethodLearn:
  Type: AWS::ApiGateway::Method
  DependsOn: 
    - ApiGatewayResourceLearn
    - LambdaFunctionLearn
  Properties:
    RestApiId: !Ref ApiGatewayRestApi
    ResourceId: !Ref ApiGatewayResourceLearn
    HttpMethod: POST
    AuthorizationType: API_KEY
    ApiKeyRequired: true
    Integration:
      Type: AWS_PROXY
      IntegrationHttpMethod: POST
      Uri: !Sub
        - arn:aws:apigateway:${AWS::Region}:lambda:path/2015-03-31/functions/${LambdaFunctionLearn.Arn}/invocations
        - LambdaFunctionLearn: !Ref LambdaFunctionLearn
    RequestParameters:
      method.request.header.Authorization: true
    MethodResponses:
      - StatusCode: 200
        ResponseParameters:
          method.response.header.Access-Control-Allow-Origin: "'*'"
```

In the above CloudFormation resource definitions, we updated the `AuthorizationType` to "API_KEY" and set `ApiKeyRequired` to true. This enforces API Key authentication for the specified API Gateway methods, ensuring that clients must include a valid API key in their requests to access the corresponding endpoints.

4. **Benefits of API Key Authentication**:

- Security: API Key authentication provides a simple yet effective way to secure APIs and prevent unauthorized access.
- Control: API owners can manage access control at the client level, enabling them to grant or revoke access as needed.
- Analytics: API Key authentication allows tracking and monitoring API usage, helping to analyze client behavior and identify potential issues.

By incorporating API Key authentication into our AWS CloudFormation template, we can effectively control access to our API Gateway endpoints and enhance the security of our APIs.
