# Chapter 11: Usage Plans and Rate Limiting with AWS CloudFormation

Usage plans and rate limiting are essential features in API Gateway that enable API owners to control and manage how clients access their APIs. In this chapter, we will explore how to implement usage plans and rate limiting for our API Gateway using AWS CloudFormation.

1. **Understanding Usage Plans and Rate Limiting**:

Usage plans allow API owners to define different tiers of access for their APIs. Each usage plan can have specific throttling and quota settings, providing fine-grained control over API usage. Rate limiting, on the other hand, restricts the number of requests a client can make to the API within a given time period.

2. **Setting up Usage Plans and Rate Limiting in AWS CloudFormation**:

To implement usage plans and rate limiting, we need to create an API usage plan and associate it with the API Gateway resource in our CloudFormation template. Below is the CloudFormation resource definition for the usage plan:

```yaml
ApiGatewayUsagePlan:
  Type: AWS::ApiGateway::UsagePlan
  DependsOn:
    - ApiGatewayDeployment
    - ApiGatewayStage
  Properties:
    ApiStages:
      - ApiId: !Ref ApiGatewayRestApi
        Stage: !Ref ApiGatewayStage
    Description: Usage plan for API key authentication
    Quota:
      Limit: 1000
      Period: MONTH
    Throttle:
      BurstLimit: 10
      RateLimit: 5
```

In the above CloudFormation resource definition, we create an API usage plan associated with the specific API Gateway stage. We set the monthly `Limit` to 1000 requests and set a `BurstLimit` of 10 and a `RateLimit` of 5 requests per second.

3. **Securing API Gateway with Usage Plans and Rate Limiting**:

Once the usage plan is created, we can associate it with the API Gateway methods to apply the rate limiting and quota settings. Below is an example of how to configure the usage plan for the "POST/blog" and "POST/learn" methods:

```yaml
ApiGatewayUsagePlanKeyBlog:
  Type: AWS::ApiGateway::UsagePlanKey
  DependsOn:
    - ApiGatewayUsagePlan
    - ApiGatewayApiKey
  Properties:
    KeyId: !Ref ApiGatewayApiKey
    KeyType: API_KEY
    UsagePlanId: !Ref ApiGatewayUsagePlan

ApiGatewayUsagePlanKeyLearn:
  Type: AWS::ApiGateway::UsagePlanKey
  DependsOn:
    - ApiGatewayUsagePlan
    - ApiGatewayApiKey
  Properties:
    KeyId: !Ref ApiGatewayApiKey
    KeyType: API_KEY
    UsagePlanId: !Ref ApiGatewayUsagePlan
```

In the above CloudFormation resource definitions, we associate the API key with the API usage plan for both the "POST/blog" and "POST/learn" methods. This ensures that the rate limiting and quota settings defined in the usage plan are applied to these methods.

4. **Benefits of Usage Plans and Rate Limiting**:

- Control: Usage plans allow API owners to define different tiers of access and control how clients consume their APIs.
- Scalability: Rate limiting prevents clients from overwhelming the API with excessive requests, ensuring fair usage and better scalability.
- Monetization: Usage plans can be used to create monetization models for APIs, enabling API owners to charge clients based on usage.

By incorporating usage plans and rate limiting into our AWS CloudFormation template, we can effectively manage API usage, prevent abuse, and ensure a smooth and controlled API experience for clients.
