#Chapter 3: Creating an API Gateway - Building an API for Your Application

Key Topics:

1. Understanding AWS API Gateway:
   - AWS API Gateway is a fully managed service that allows you to create, deploy, and manage APIs for your applications.
   - It acts as a front-door for your backend services, enabling you to expose RESTful or WebSocket APIs to clients.

2. Adding API Gateway to Your CDK Application:
   - To create an API Gateway in your CDK application, you need to import the necessary modules from the AWS CDK library.
   - Use the `aws-apigateway` module to define the API and its resources.

   Example:
   ```typescript
   import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
   import * as apigateway from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-apigateway';

   // Inside your CDK Stack constructor
   const api = new apigateway.RestApi(this, 'MyApi', {
     restApiName: 'My API',
     description: 'API for my application',
   });
   ```

3. Creating API Resources:
   - In API Gateway, resources are the building blocks of your API's URL structure.
   - You can define resources and sub-resources to organize your API endpoints logically.

   Example:
   ```typescript
   // Define root resource and a sub-resource
   const rootResource = api.root;
   const itemsResource = api.root.addResource('items');
   ```

4. Defining API Methods:
   - API methods represent the different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) that your API supports.
   - You can add methods to API resources and link them to Lambda functions that handle the request.

   Example:
   ```typescript
   // Add a GET method to the root resource
   rootResource.addMethod('GET', new apigateway.LambdaIntegration(myLambdaFunction));

   // Add a POST method to the sub-resource
   itemsResource.addMethod('POST', new apigateway.LambdaIntegration(createItemLambdaFunction));
   ```

5. Configuring Method Responses and Integration Responses:
   - Method responses define the HTTP status codes and response models that your API returns.
   - Integration responses specify how to map backend responses to HTTP responses.

   Example:
   ```typescript
   // Add method response for HTTP status code 200
   const methodResponse200 = {
     statusCode: '200',
     responseModels: {
       'application/json': new apigateway.Model({ schema: { type: apigateway.JsonSchemaType.OBJECT } }),
     },
   };
   api.addMethodResponse('GET', methodResponse200);

   // Add integration response to map Lambda function response to HTTP response
   const integrationResponse200 = {
     statusCode: '200',
     responseTemplates: {
       'application/json': JSON.stringify({ message: 'Success' }),
     },
   };
   api.addIntegrationResponse('GET', integrationResponse200);
   ```

6. Deploying the API:
   - After defining your API and its resources, you need to deploy it to make it accessible to clients.
   - API Gateway allows you to deploy multiple stages, such as test, development, and production.

   Example:
   ```typescript
   // Deploy the API to a stage called 'prod'
   const deployment = new apigateway.Deployment(this, 'Deployment', {
     api,
     description: 'Deployment for the production stage',
   });
   new apigateway.Stage(this, 'ProdStage', {
     deployment,
     stageName: 'prod',
   });
   ```

7. Securing the API:
   - API Gateway provides various security options to protect your API, such as API keys, IAM authentication, and custom authorizers.
   - You can add security measures to your API to control access and prevent unauthorized usage.

   Example:
   ```typescript
   // Enable API key for the API
   const apiKey = api.addApiKey('MyApiKey');
   const plan = api.addUsagePlan('MyUsagePlan', {
     apiKey,
     throttle: {
       rateLimit: 500,
       burstLimit: 1000,
     },
   });
   plan.addApiStage({
     stage: api.deploymentStage,
     throttle: [
       {
         method: api.root.addMethod('GET'),
         throttle: {
           rateLimit: 100,
           burstLimit: 200,
         },
       },
     ],
   });
   ```
