#Chapter 2: Setting Up Your AWS CDK Environment - Preparing for Resource Deployment

Key Topics:

1. Installing AWS CDK and Configuring Credentials:
   - Before you can start working with AWS CDK, you need to install the required software and configure your AWS credentials.
   - Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) if you haven't already, as AWS CDK is built on Node.js.

   Example:
   ```
   // Check if Node.js and npm are installed
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

   - Next, you can install AWS CDK using npm by running the command `npm install -g aws-cdk`.
   
   Example:
   ```
   // Install AWS CDK using npm
   npm install -g aws-cdk
   ```

   - After installing CDK, you need to configure your AWS credentials. This involves creating an IAM user with the necessary permissions and setting up AWS CLI on your local machine.

   Example:
   ```
   // Configure AWS CLI with your IAM user credentials
   aws configure
   ```

2. Creating a New CDK Project:
   - Once you have AWS CDK installed and your credentials set up, you can create a new CDK project.
   - Use the command `cdk init` to initialize a new project. This will prompt you to choose a programming language (TypeScript, Python, Java, etc.) and create a basic CDK application structure for you.

   Example:
   ```
   // Create a new CDK project using TypeScript
   cdk init app --language=typescript
   ```

   - This application structure includes a sample stack that you can use as a starting point for defining your AWS resources.

3. Understanding the CDK Application Structure:
   - When you create a new CDK project, it generates a basic application structure with important files and directories.
   - The `app.ts` file serves as the entry point of your CDK application and defines the main stack that you want to deploy.

   Example:
   ```typescript
   // app.ts
   import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
   import { MyStack } from '../lib/my-stack';

   const app = new cdk.App();
   new MyStack(app, 'MyStack');
   app.synth();
   ```

   - The `lib` directory contains the main code for your CDK stacks, where you define the AWS resources and their configurations.

   Example:
   ```typescript
   // lib/my-stack.ts
   import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
   import * as s3 from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3';

   export class MyStack extends cdk.Stack {
     constructor(scope: cdk.Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
       super(scope, id, props);

       // Define AWS resources in this stack
       new s3.Bucket(this, 'MyS3Bucket', {
         bucketName: 'my-unique-s3-bucket',
       });
     }
   }
   ```

4. Defining Stacks and Constructing Resources:
   - In CDK, a stack is a collection of AWS resources that are created and managed together.
   - You can define multiple stacks within your CDK application, each representing a different set of resources.

   Example:
   ```typescript
   // lib/my-stack.ts
   import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
   import * as s3 from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3';
   import * as dynamodb from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-dynamodb';

   export class MyStack extends cdk.Stack {
     constructor(scope: cdk.Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
       super(scope, id, props);

       // Define an S3 bucket
       new s3.Bucket(this, 'MyS3Bucket', {
         bucketName: 'my-unique-s3-bucket',
       });

       // Define a DynamoDB table
       new dynamodb.Table(this, 'MyDynamoDBTable', {
         tableName: 'my-dynamodb-table',
         partitionKey: { name: 'ID', type: dynamodb.AttributeType.STRING },
       });
     }
   }
   ```
