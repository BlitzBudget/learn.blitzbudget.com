# Chapter 13: Golang Web Development - Part 1

In this chapter, we'll begin exploring web development in Go, starting with an overview of popular Golang web frameworks and building a simple HTTP server using the standard library.

## Overview of Golang Web Frameworks

Go offers a variety of web frameworks to choose from, each designed to simplify web development and provide essential features. Some popular Golang web frameworks include:

1. **Gin**: A fast and lightweight web framework with a martini-like API, suitable for building RESTful APIs and web applications.

2. **Echo**: A high-performance and minimalistic web framework with a focus on simplicity and speed.

3. **Gorilla**: A toolkit that provides various packages for building web applications, including a powerful router and middleware support.

4. **Beego**: A full-featured web framework with built-in ORM, caching, and internationalization support, suitable for large-scale applications.

5. **Revel**: A full-stack web framework with features like hot code reloading, scaffolding, and a testing framework.

For this chapter, we'll use the standard library to build a simple HTTP server. However, feel free to explore the above frameworks for more advanced web development needs.

## Building a Simple HTTP Server

To build a simple HTTP server in Go, we'll use the `net/http` package, which provides all the necessary functionality for handling HTTP requests and responses.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
)

func main() {
    // Define the route handler function
    helloHandler := func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        fmt.Fprint(w, "Hello, World!")
    }

    // Register the route handler function to the URL path
    http.HandleFunc("/", helloHandler)

    // Start the HTTP server on port 8080
    err := http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error starting the server:", err)
    }
}
```

To run this simple HTTP server, save the code in a file (e.g., `main.go`) and execute the following command in the terminal:

```
go run main.go
```

Now, you should have a running HTTP server that responds with "Hello, World!" to any incoming request.

## Conclusion

In this chapter, we started our journey into web development in Go by providing an overview of popular Golang web frameworks. Additionally, we built a simple HTTP server using the standard library to get a glimpse of handling HTTP requests and responses.

In the next chapter, we'll explore routing and handling different HTTP methods to create more dynamic and interactive web applications. Let's continue our journey to master Golang web development!
