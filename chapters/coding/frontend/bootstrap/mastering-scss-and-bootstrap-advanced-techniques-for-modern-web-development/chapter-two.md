# Chapter 2: Getting Started with SCSS

In the previous chapter, we introduced SCSS and its benefits for writing maintainable and modular CSS. Now, let's dive deeper into the world of SCSS and learn how to set up our project, use variables, mixins, nesting, and more to streamline our styling process.

## Setting Up SCSS in Your Project

Before we start using SCSS in our project, we need to set up the necessary tools and directory structure. Let's go through the steps to get started:

1. **Install Node.js and npm**: If you haven't already installed Node.js and npm, head to the official website and download the latest version. Node.js will also include npm, which is essential for managing our project dependencies.

2. **Create a New Project Directory**: Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it in your terminal or command prompt.

3. **Initialize a Package.json File**: Run the following command to initialize a package.json file for your project:

```bash
npm init -y
```

4. **Install SCSS Compiler**: We will use the `sass` package to compile our SCSS code into CSS. Install it as a project dependency:

```bash
npm install sass --save-dev
```

5. **Create Directory Structure**: In your project directory, create a folder called `src` where you will store your SCSS files. Inside the `src` folder, create an `index.scss` file to write your SCSS code.

6. **Set Up SCSS Compilation Script**: In your package.json, add a script to compile your SCSS code to CSS. Open package.json and add the following line under `"scripts"`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build:scss": "sass src/index.scss dist/styles.css"
}
```

Now, you have set up the foundation for using SCSS in your project. Let's start writing some SCSS code!

## SCSS Variables: Making Styling Flexible

One of the key features of SCSS is the ability to use variables. Variables allow us to define reusable values that we can use throughout our stylesheets. Let's create a simple example to demonstrate the power of variables.

### Example: Creating a Customizable Button

Imagine that we want to create a customizable button with different colors for the background and text. Instead of hard-coding the colors directly into our CSS, we can use variables to make the button more flexible.

```scss
// src/index.scss

// Define variables
$primary-color: #007bff;
$secondary-color: #6c757d;
$button-padding: 10px 20px;
$button-border: none;
$button-border-radius: 5px;

// Styling for the primary button
.btn-primary {
  background-color: $primary-color;
  color: white;
  padding: $button-padding;
  border: $button-border;
  border-radius: $button-border-radius;
}

// Styling for the secondary button
.btn-secondary {
  background-color: $secondary-color;
  color: white;
  padding: $button-padding;
  border: $button-border;
  border-radius: $button-border-radius;
}
```

In this example, we defined variables for the primary and secondary colors, as well as for the button's padding and border properties. Now, we can easily create buttons with different color combinations without duplicating the styles.

## SCSS Mixins: Reusing Blocks of Styles

SCSS mixins allow us to define reusable blocks of CSS that we can include in multiple rules. This helps reduce code duplication and makes our stylesheets more organized.

### Example: Creating a Mixin for Box Shadows

Let's create a mixin that defines a box shadow with a specified color and offset.

```scss
// src/index.scss

// Define a mixin for box shadow
@mixin box-shadow($color, $offsetX, $offsetY) {
  box-shadow: $offsetX $offsetY 5px $color;
}

// Usage of the mixin
.card {
  width: 300px;
  height: 200px;
  background-color: #f8f9fa;
  @include box-shadow($primary-color, 0, 0);
}

.button {
  padding: 10px 20px;
  background-color: $primary-color;
  color: white;
  @include box-shadow($secondary-color, 2px, 2px);
}
```

In this example, we defined a mixin called `box-shadow` that takes three parameters: `$color`, `$offsetX`, and `$offsetY`. The mixin is used to add a box shadow to both a `.card` and a `.button`, each with a different color and offset.

## SCSS Nesting: Cleaner and More Readable Code

SCSS allows us to nest our CSS rules, making our code more structured and easier to read. This nesting mirrors the HTML structure of our page and helps us better visualize the styles.

### Example: Styling Nested Elements

```scss
// src/index.scss

.container {
  max-width: 1200px;
  margin: 0 auto;

  .header {
    background-color: $primary-color;
    color: white;
    padding: 20px;

    h1 {
      font-size

: 32px;
      margin-bottom: 10px;
    }

    p {
      font-size: 16px;
    }
  }

  .main-content {
    padding: 20px;

    .post {
      background-color: #f8f9fa;
      padding: 10px;
      margin-bottom: 20px;

      h2 {
        font-size: 24px;
        margin-bottom: 10px;
      }

      p {
        font-size: 16px;
      }

      .meta {
        font-size: 12px;
        color: #6c757d;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, we defined styles for a simple page layout with a header and main content area. The use of nesting helps us visualize the hierarchy of the page and keeps our styles organized.

## Conclusion

In this chapter, we explored the basics of working with SCSS. We set up our project to use SCSS, learned about variables, mixins, and nesting, and saw how they can enhance our CSS development process. With SCSS, we can write more maintainable and flexible styles for our web applications.

In the next chapter, we will dive even deeper into SCSS and explore more advanced features, including functions, loops, and conditional statements. Get ready to take your styling skills to the next level with SCSS!
