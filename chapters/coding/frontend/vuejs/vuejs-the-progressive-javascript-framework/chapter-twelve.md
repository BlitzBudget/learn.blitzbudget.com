# Chapter 12: Vue.js Animation and Transitions

Animations and transitions play a vital role in enhancing the user experience of web applications. In this chapter, we will explore Vue.js's built-in animation and transition features that allow us to create smooth and engaging visual effects in our Vue.js applications. We will cover various animation techniques, custom transitions, and practical examples to demonstrate the power and versatility of Vue.js animations.

## Why Animations and Transitions Matter

Animations and transitions add life to web applications, making them more interactive, appealing, and user-friendly. They can improve the overall user experience and provide visual feedback, making the application more intuitive to use. Some key reasons why animations and transitions matter in Vue.js applications include:

1. **Enhanced User Experience**: Animations can guide users through the application, draw attention to specific elements, and provide context during navigation, creating a more engaging experience.

2. **Visual Feedback**: Transitions provide visual cues to users about changes in the application's state, making the interactions feel smoother and more responsive.

3. **Brand Identity**: Well-designed animations and transitions can reflect the application's brand and personality, helping to create a consistent and memorable user experience.

4. **User Retention**: Engaging animations can increase user retention by making the application more enjoyable and encouraging users to stay longer.

## Vue.js Animation Basics

Vue.js provides a powerful and easy-to-use API for adding animations to components and elements. The main building blocks for creating animations in Vue.js include:

1. **Transition Component**: The `<transition>` component allows us to apply CSS transitions and animations when elements are added, removed, or updated in the DOM. It wraps the element that we want to animate and supports various events like `enter`, `leave`, and `move`.

2. **Transition Classes**: The `<transition>` component adds and removes classes to elements based on their lifecycle events. We can define custom classes and styles for the animations.

3. **Animation Hooks**: Vue.js provides lifecycle hooks that allow us to customize animations further. For example, we can use the `before-enter`, `enter`, and `after-enter` hooks to control the animation timing and behavior.

## Creating Animations with `<transition>`

Let's start by exploring how to create basic animations using the `<transition>` component.

### Example: Fading In and Out

Suppose we have a component that we want to fade in and out when it appears and disappears from the DOM:

```vue
<template>
  <transition name="fade">
    <div v-if="isVisible" class="fade-in-out">Hello, Vue.js!</div>
  </transition>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      isVisible: false,
    };
  },
  mounted() {
    // Show the element after a delay for demonstration purposes
    setTimeout(() => {
      this.isVisible = true;
    }, 1000);
  },
};
</script>

<style>
.fade-enter-active,
.fade-leave-active {
  transition: opacity 0.5s;
}

.fade-enter, .fade-leave-to /* .fade-leave-active in <2.1.8 */ {
  opacity: 0;
}
</style>
```

In this example, we use the `<transition>` component to apply a fade-in and fade-out effect to the message "Hello, Vue.js!" when it appears and disappears from the DOM. The `name` attribute on the `<transition>` component allows us to define a CSS class prefix for the transitions.

## Custom Transitions with `<transition-group>`

The `<transition-group>` component allows us to animate lists of items as they change. This is particularly useful when we add or remove items from a dynamic list.

### Example: List Animation

Suppose we have a list of items, and we want to animate items when they are added or removed from the list:

```vue
<template>
  <transition-group name="slide">
    <div v-for="item in items" :key="item.id" class="list-item">{{ item.text }}</div>
  </transition-group>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      items: [
        { id: 1, text: 'Item 1' },
        { id: 2, text: 'Item 2' },
        { id: 3, text: 'Item 3' },
      ],
    };
  },
  methods: {
    addItem() {
      const newItem = { id: this.items.length + 1, text: `Item ${this.items.length + 1}` };
      this.items.push(newItem);
    },
    removeItem() {
      this.items.pop();
    },
  },
};
</script>

<style>
.slide-enter-active, .slide-leave-active {
  transition: all 1s;
}

.slide-enter, .slide-leave-to /* .slide-leave-active in <2.1.8 */ {
  transform: translateY(30px);
  opacity: 0;
}
</style>
```

In this example, we use the `<transition-group>` component to apply a sliding animation to the list items when they are added or removed. The `name` attribute on the `<transition-group>` component allows us to define a CSS class prefix for the transitions.

## Vue.js Transition Hooks

Vue.js provides several lifecycle hooks that allow us to further customize and control animations:

- `before-enter`: Called before the element is inserted into the DOM.
- `enter`: Called after the element is inserted into the DOM.
- `after-enter`: Called after the transition has finished.
- `before-leave`: Called before the element is removed from the DOM.
- `leave`: Called after the element is removed from the DOM.
- `after-leave`: Called after the transition has finished.

### Example: Custom Animation with Transition Hooks

Suppose we want to create a custom animation where an element slides in from the left when it appears and slides out to the right when it disappears:

```vue
<template>
  <transition
    @before-enter="beforeEnter"
    @enter="enter"
    @after-enter="afterEnter"
    @before-leave="beforeLeave"
    @leave="leave"
    @after-leave="afterLeave"
  >
    <div v-if="isVisible" class="custom-animation">Custom Animation</div>
  </transition>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      isVisible: false,
    };
  },
  methods: {
    beforeEnter(el) {
      el.style.transform = 'translateX(-100%)';
      el.style.opacity = 0;
    },
    enter(el, done) {
      el.style.transition = 'all 1s';
      el.style.transform = 'translateX(0)';
      el.style.opacity = 1;
      done();
    },
    afterEnter(el) {
      el.style.transition = '';
    },
    beforeLeave(el) {
      el.style.transition = 'all 1s';
    },
    leave(el, done) {
      el.style.transform = 'translateX(100%)';


      el.style.opacity = 0;
      done();
    },
    afterLeave(el) {
      el.style.transition = '';
    },
  },
};
</script>

<style>
.custom-animation {
  width: 200px;
  height: 50px;
  background-color: #3498db;
  color: #fff;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

</style>
```

In this example, we use the transition hooks to create a custom animation where the element slides in from the left when it appears (`enter` hook) and slides out to the right when it disappears (`leave` hook).

## Vue.js Animation Libraries

While Vue.js provides built-in animation capabilities, some animation libraries can simplify complex animations and provide additional features. Two popular animation libraries for Vue.js are:

1. **Velocity.js**: Velocity.js is a lightweight animation library that works seamlessly with Vue.js. It provides extensive animation capabilities and is known for its performance.

2. **Anime.js**: Anime.js is a powerful animation library that allows you to create complex animations with ease. It supports a wide range of properties and allows you to chain multiple animations together.
