# Chapter 1: Introduction to Nuxt.js

Nuxt.js is a powerful and versatile framework for building Vue.js applications. With its built-in server-side rendering (SSR) capabilities, Nuxt.js enables developers to create performant and SEO-friendly applications that provide a smooth user experience. In this chapter, we will dive into the fundamentals of Nuxt.js, exploring its architecture, features, and benefits. We will walk through practical examples to help you understand the core concepts of Nuxt.js and how it simplifies the development process.

## What is Nuxt.js?

Nuxt.js is a progressive framework for building Vue.js applications. It is designed to enhance the development experience by providing built-in features and conventions, allowing developers to focus on building robust applications rather than setting up configurations from scratch. Nuxt.js builds on top of Vue.js and extends its capabilities with features like server-side rendering, static site generation, and more.

## Setting Up a Nuxt.js Project

Getting started with Nuxt.js is straightforward. We'll walk through the process of setting up a new Nuxt.js project using the Vue CLI and explore the project structure.

### Step 1: Install Vue CLI

If you don't have the Vue CLI installed, you can do so using npm:

```bash
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

### Step 2: Create a Nuxt.js Project

Use the Vue CLI to create a new Nuxt.js project:

```bash
vue create my-nuxt-app
```

Select the default preset or manually select features as needed.

### Step 3: Explore the Project Structure

The generated project will have a well-organized structure. Key directories include:

- `assets`: Contains static assets like images and styles.
- `components`: Houses reusable Vue components.
- `layouts`: Contains layout components to structure your pages.
- `pages`: Each file in this directory represents a page route.
- `plugins`: Houses Vue plugins that you want to use in your application.
- `store`: Contains Vuex store modules for state management.

## Pages and Routing in Nuxt.js

In Nuxt.js, pages are automatically associated with routes. We'll explore how to create pages, define routes, and navigate between them.

### Step 1: Creating Pages

To create a new page, simply add a `.vue` file in the `pages` directory. For example, to create a `Home` page:

```html
<!-- pages/index.vue -->
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Welcome to Nuxt.js</h1>
    <p>Enjoy building Vue.js applications with ease!</p>
  </div>
</template>
```

### Step 2: Defining Routes

Nuxt.js automatically generates routes based on the files in the `pages` directory. Each `.vue` file represents a route. For example, the `index.vue` file will be associated with the root route `/`.

### Step 3: Navigating Between Pages

To navigate between pages, we use the `<nuxt-link>` component, which is similar to Vue Router's `<router-link>`. The `<nuxt-link>` automatically generates links based on the defined routes.

```html
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Welcome to Nuxt.js</h1>
    <p>Enjoy building Vue.js applications with ease!</p>
    <nuxt-link to="/about">Learn more about Nuxt.js</nuxt-link>
  </div>
</template>
```

## Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with Nuxt.js

One of the key features of Nuxt.js is server-side rendering (SSR), which greatly improves SEO and initial page load performance. SSR allows the server to pre-render the pages and deliver fully rendered HTML to the client.

### How SSR Works in Nuxt.js

When a user requests a page, the server runs the Vue.js application and renders the page's initial state. This rendered HTML is sent to the client, improving the page's time-to-interactive and search engine visibility.

### Enabling SSR in Nuxt.js

SSR is enabled by default in Nuxt.js. You can verify this by checking the `<html>` tag in the page source, where the server-rendered content is present.

## Conclusion

In this chapter, we introduced you to Nuxt.js, a powerful framework for building Vue.js applications with ease. We covered the basics of Nuxt.js, including project setup, pages, routing, and server-side rendering. Armed with this knowledge, you are ready to embark on your Nuxt.js journey and build modern, performant, and SEO-friendly Vue.js applications.
