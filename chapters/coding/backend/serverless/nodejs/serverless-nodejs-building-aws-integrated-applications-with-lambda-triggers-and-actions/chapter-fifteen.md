# Chapter 15: Creating a Node.js Lambda Function with SNS Trigger

Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) is a fully managed messaging service that enables you to send messages or notifications to distributed systems and mobile devices. In this chapter, we'll explore how to create a serverless Node.js Lambda function that's triggered by an SNS topic. This will allow you to send notifications, alerts, or any custom messages from your serverless applications to various subscribers.

## Why Use SNS with Lambda

SNS provides a flexible and scalable way to broadcast messages to multiple subscribers simultaneously. By integrating SNS with Lambda, you can build powerful event-driven architectures that trigger Lambda functions in response to specific events. This decoupled approach ensures that the application's components can evolve independently, leading to better scalability, reliability, and maintainability.

## How SNS Triggers Lambda

When you publish a message to an SNS topic, the service will deliver the message to all its subscribers, including Lambda functions. To trigger a Lambda function with SNS, you need to configure the function as a subscriber to the topic. When a new message is published to the topic, SNS forwards the message to the Lambda function, and the function's code is executed with the message payload.

## Step-by-Step: Creating a Node.js Lambda Function with SNS Trigger

In this section, we'll guide you through the process of creating a serverless Node.js Lambda function that's triggered by an SNS topic. We'll assume that you have already set up an SNS topic and have the necessary permissions to create Lambda functions.

### Step 1: Set Up the SNS Topic

1. Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the SNS service.

2. Click on "Topics" and then "Create topic."

3. Provide a name and a display name for your topic.

4. Click "Create topic" to create the SNS topic.

### Step 2: Create the Lambda Function

1. Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Lambda service.

2. Click on "Create function."

3. Choose "Author from scratch."

4. Provide a name for your Lambda function.

5. For the runtime, select "Node.js."

6. Under "Permissions," choose an existing role with the necessary permissions or create a new role with the `lambda.amazonaws.com` service as a trusted entity and the required permissions for SNS.

7. Click "Create function" to create the Lambda function.

### Step 3: Configure the SNS Trigger

1. In the Lambda function page, go to the "Designer" section and click on "Add trigger."

2. Select "SNS" from the trigger options.

3. In the "Configure triggers" section, select the SNS topic you created in Step 1.

4. Click "Add" to add the trigger.

### Step 4: Implement the Lambda Function

Now that we have set up the Lambda function with the SNS trigger, let's implement the function's code to handle the incoming SNS messages.

```javascript
exports.handler = async (event, context) => {
  try {
    const message = event.Records[0].Sns.Message;

    // Your custom logic based on the SNS message goes here
    console.log('Received SNS message:', message);

    return {
      statusCode: 200,
      body: JSON.stringify('SNS message processed successfully.'),
    };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error processing SNS message:', error);
    return {
      statusCode: 500,
      body: JSON.stringify('Error processing SNS message.'),
    };
  }
};
```

In this example, the Lambda function receives the SNS message payload from the `event` parameter. The code retrieves the message using `event.Records[0].Sns.Message` and performs custom logic based on the message content. For demonstration purposes, we are logging the message to the console. In a real-world scenario, you can perform any action based on the SNS message, such as sending an email, updating a database, or triggering other Lambda functions.

### Step 5: Publish a Message to the SNS Topic

With the Lambda function and SNS trigger set up, you can now publish a message to the SNS topic to trigger the Lambda function.

1. Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the SNS service.

2. Click on "Topics" and select the topic you created in Step 1.

3. Click on "Publish message."

4. Enter the message you want to send in the "Message body" field.

5. Optionally, provide a "Subject" for the message.

6. Click "Publish" to send the message.

### Step 6: Monitor the Lambda Function

After publishing the message to the SNS topic, the Lambda function will be triggered automatically. You can monitor the function's execution and view the logs in the AWS Management Console under the Lambda service. Check the logs to see the output of the custom logic executed by the Lambda function based on the SNS message.

## Conclusion

In this chapter, we explored how to create a serverless Node.js Lambda function with an SNS trigger. By integrating SNS with Lambda, you can easily send notifications, alerts, or any custom messages from your serverless applications to multiple subscribers. We covered the step-by-step process of setting up

 the SNS topic, creating the Lambda function, configuring the SNS trigger, implementing the Lambda function's code, and testing the trigger with a sample message.

Integrating SNS with Lambda allows you to build event-driven architectures that respond to various events efficiently. As your serverless applications grow, you can leverage SNS to enhance communication and coordination between different components.
