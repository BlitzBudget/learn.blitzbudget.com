**Chapter 2: Setting Up AWS Account and CLI**

In this chapter, we'll walk you through the process of setting up an AWS (Amazon Web Services) account and installing the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI). Having an AWS account is a fundamental step in building and deploying serverless applications, as it provides access to a wide range of cloud services that can be integrated with your Go applications. The AWS CLI, on the other hand, simplifies interaction with AWS services from your local development environment, enabling you to manage resources and deploy applications with ease.

**Step 1: Creating an AWS Account**

If you don't already have an AWS account, follow these steps to create one:

1. Go to the AWS website (https://aws.amazon.com/) and click on "Create an AWS Account."
2. Provide the necessary information, such as your email address, password, and account name.
3. Choose a support plan (Basic, Developer, Business, or Enterprise) based on your needs and preferences.
4. Enter your payment information to set up billing for your AWS account. Some services offer a free tier, which allows you to use certain AWS resources at no cost for a limited time.
5. Complete the registration process, and you'll receive a verification email to confirm your account.

**Step 2: Installing the AWS CLI**

The AWS CLI is a powerful tool that allows you to interact with AWS services from the command line. Follow the steps below to install the AWS CLI on your local machine:

**For Windows:**

1. Download the AWS CLI installer for Windows from the AWS website.
2. Run the downloaded installer, and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

**For macOS:**

1. Open Terminal, which is pre-installed on macOS.
2. Install the AWS CLI using the package manager "Homebrew" by running the following command:
   ```
   brew install awscli
   ```

**For Linux:**

1. Open your terminal and run the appropriate package manager command for your Linux distribution to install the AWS CLI. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use the following command:
   ```
   sudo apt-get install awscli
   ```

**Configuring the AWS CLI**

Once the AWS CLI is installed, you need to configure it with your AWS credentials:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command to start the configuration process:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```

3. You'll be prompted to enter your AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key. These credentials can be found in your AWS Management Console under "My Security Credentials" in the "IAM" service.
4. Specify your default AWS region. This is the region where your AWS resources will be provisioned by default. You can find a list of AWS regions in the AWS documentation.
5. Optionally, you can set the output format for AWS CLI commands. The default format is JSON.

**Verifying the AWS CLI Setup**

To ensure that the AWS CLI is set up correctly, you can run a simple command to list your AWS S3 buckets:

```
aws s3 ls
```

If everything is set up correctly, you'll see a list of your S3 buckets.

**Conclusion**

Congratulations! You've successfully set up your AWS account and installed the AWS CLI. You're now equipped with the necessary tools to start building and deploying serverless applications with Go on AWS. In the upcoming chapters, we'll delve into practical examples of integrating AWS services with your Go applications, enabling you to harness the power of serverless architecture to build scalable and efficient solutions.
