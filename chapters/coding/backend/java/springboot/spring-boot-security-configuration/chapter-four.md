# Chapter 4: Form-Based Authentication in Spring Boot

In this chapter, we'll dive into the realm of form-based authentication in Spring Boot applications. Form-based authentication is a user-friendly approach that allows users to authenticate by submitting their credentials through a login form. We'll explore the process of creating a custom login form, configuring login processing URLs, defining success and failure URLs, and implementing logout functionality. By mastering form-based authentication, developers can create secure and user-friendly authentication experiences for their applications.

## 1. Introduction to Form-Based Authentication

Form-based authentication is a widely used authentication mechanism in web applications. It provides a user-friendly way for users to enter their credentials through a login form, which is then submitted to the server for validation. Spring Boot Security simplifies the implementation of form-based authentication by offering pre-configured components and customizable options.

## 2. Creating a Custom Login Form

To create a custom login form, you'll need to design a login page where users can input their credentials. Spring Boot makes it easy to integrate this form with the authentication process.

### Example: Custom Login Form

```html
<!-- src/main/resources/templates/login.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Login Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>Login</h2>
    <form action="/login" method="post">
        <label for="username">Username:</label>
        <input type="text" id="username" name="username" required><br><br>
        <label for="password">Password:</label>
        <input type="password" id="password" name="password" required><br><br>
        <input type="submit" value="Login">
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, we've created a basic HTML form with input fields for the username and password. The form's `action` attribute is set to `/login`, which is the default URL for processing login requests.

## 3. Configuring Login Processing URL and Success/Failure URLs

Configuring the login processing URL and success/failure URLs is essential for a seamless authentication experience. Spring Boot Security provides configuration options to customize these URLs.

### Example: Configuration for Login Processing and URLs

```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.EnableWebSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;

@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeRequests()
                .antMatchers("/login", "/public/**").permitAll()
                .anyRequest().authenticated()
                .and()
            .formLogin()
                .loginPage("/custom-login")
                .loginProcessingUrl("/authenticate")
                .defaultSuccessUrl("/dashboard")
                .failureUrl("/login?error=true")
                .permitAll()
                .and()
            .logout()
                .logoutUrl("/logout")
                .logoutSuccessUrl("/public/index")
                .permitAll();
    }
}
```

In this example, we're configuring the security settings using the `HttpSecurity` object. We've customized the following aspects:
- The `antMatchers` method permits access to the login page and public resources.
- The `loginPage` method sets a custom login page URL.
- The `loginProcessingUrl` method specifies the URL for processing login requests.
- The `defaultSuccessUrl` method defines the URL to redirect users upon successful authentication.
- The `failureUrl` method sets the URL for redirection after a failed authentication attempt.
- The `logoutUrl` method specifies the URL for logging out.
- The `logoutSuccessUrl` method defines the URL to redirect users after successful logout.

## 4. Implementing Logout Functionality

Implementing logout functionality ensures that users can securely end their sessions. Spring Boot Security simplifies logout configuration with built-in options.

### Example: Logout Configuration

```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.EnableWebSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;

@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            // Other configurations
            .logout()
                .logoutUrl("/logout")
                .logoutSuccessUrl("/public/index")
                .invalidateHttpSession(true)
                .deleteCookies("JSESSIONID")
                .permitAll();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `logout` method configures the logout process:
- The `logoutUrl` method sets the URL for logging out.
- The `logoutSuccessUrl` method defines the URL to redirect users after successful logout.
- The `invalidateHttpSession` method invalidates the user's session upon logout.
- The `deleteCookies` method removes

 specific cookies upon logout.

## 5. Example: Building a Secure Web Application

Let's explore a comprehensive example of building a secure web application with form-based authentication. Suppose you're developing an online shopping platform where users need to authenticate to access their accounts and perform transactions.

### Example: Secure Web Application

1. Create a custom login page (`login.html`) that aligns with your application's design and branding.
2. Configure the security settings in the `SecurityConfig` class to include custom URLs for login processing, success, and failure.
3. Implement user registration and management, including storing user information securely.
4. Secure other sensitive endpoints and resources using Spring Security's configurations.

By following these steps, you'll create a robust and secure web application that provides users with a seamless and protected experience.

## Conclusion

Form-based authentication is a user-friendly and effective method for securing web applications. By creating a custom login form, configuring login processing and URL redirection, and implementing logout functionality, developers can ensure both security and user convenience. The provided examples illustrate how these concepts can be implemented in a Spring Boot application. In the next chapter, we'll explore another layer of security: authorization.
