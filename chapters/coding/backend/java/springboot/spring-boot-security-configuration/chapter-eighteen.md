# Chapter 18: Advanced Security Configuration in Spring Boot

In this chapter, we will explore advanced security configuration techniques in Spring Boot applications. As your application's security requirements become more complex, advanced configurations can provide greater flexibility and customization. We will delve into defining custom security configuration classes, extending `SecurityConfigurerAdapter` for advanced cases, and combining multiple authentication providers. By mastering these advanced techniques, developers can tailor security configurations to their application's specific needs.

## 1. The Need for Advanced Security Configuration

As applications grow in complexity, standard security configurations may not cover all use cases. Advanced security configurations offer fine-tuned control over security features.

### 1.1 Tailoring Security to Application Requirements

Advanced security configuration allows developers to tailor security settings to meet specific business requirements.

### 1.2 Handling Complex Authentication Scenarios

Advanced configurations can handle intricate authentication scenarios involving various user types and authentication mechanisms.

## 2. Defining Custom Security Configuration Classes

Defining custom security configuration classes provides the flexibility to configure security settings beyond the default configurations.

### 2.1 Creating a Custom Security Configuration

Create a custom configuration class by extending `SecurityConfigurerAdapter` and overriding configuration methods.

#### Example: Custom Security Configuration

```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class CustomSecurityConfig extends SecurityConfigurerAdapter<DefaultSecurityFilterChain, HttpSecurity> {

    @Override
    public void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeRequests()
                .antMatchers("/custom/**").hasRole("CUSTOM_ROLE")
                .and()
            .formLogin()
                .loginPage("/login")
                .defaultSuccessUrl("/custom-dashboard");
    }
}
```

In this example, the `CustomSecurityConfig` class defines a custom security configuration for specific URLs.

## 3. Extending `SecurityConfigurerAdapter` for Advanced Cases

Extending `SecurityConfigurerAdapter` enables advanced security customization by overriding methods to configure specific aspects.

### 3.1 Handling Token-Based Authentication

Extending `SecurityConfigurerAdapter` allows the customization of token-based authentication mechanisms.

#### Example: Custom Token Authentication Configuration

```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class TokenSecurityConfig extends SecurityConfigurerAdapter<DefaultSecurityFilterChain, HttpSecurity> {

    @Override
    public void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeRequests()
                .antMatchers("/token/**").authenticated()
                .and()
            .addFilterBefore(new TokenAuthenticationFilter(), UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `TokenSecurityConfig` class extends `SecurityConfigurerAdapter` to handle token-based authentication.

## 4. Combining Multiple Authentication Providers

Combining multiple authentication providers allows for multi-factor authentication and increased security.

### 4.1 Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication

Combining authentication providers allows developers to implement multi-factor authentication by requiring multiple authentication methods.

#### Example: Multi-Factor Authentication Configuration

```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class MultiFactorSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Autowired
    private CustomAuthenticationProvider customAuthenticationProvider;
    
    @Autowired
    private TokenAuthenticationProvider tokenAuthenticationProvider;

    @Override
    protected void configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception {
        auth
            .authenticationProvider(customAuthenticationProvider)
            .authenticationProvider(tokenAuthenticationProvider);
    }

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeRequests()
                .antMatchers("/multi-factor/**").authenticated()
                .and()
            .formLogin()
                .loginPage("/login")
                .defaultSuccessUrl("/multi-factor-dashboard");
    }
}
```

In this example, the `MultiFactorSecurityConfig` class combines custom and token authentication providers for multi-factor authentication.

## 5. Example: Advanced Security Configuration in Action

Let's explore a real-world example of implementing advanced security configuration in a Spring Boot application.

### 5.1 Scenario: Healthcare Application

Consider a healthcare application that deals with sensitive patient information and requires multi-factor authentication.

#### Example: Advanced Security Configuration Implementation

```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class HealthcareSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Autowired
    private CustomAuthenticationProvider customAuthenticationProvider;
    
    @Autowired
    private TokenAuthenticationProvider tokenAuthenticationProvider;

    @Override
    protected void configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception {
        auth
            .authenticationProvider(customAuthenticationProvider)
            .authenticationProvider(tokenAuthenticationProvider);
    }

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeRequests()
                .antMatchers("/healthcare/**").authenticated()
                .and()
            .formLogin()
                .loginPage("/login")
                .defaultSuccessUrl("/healthcare-dashboard");
    }
}
```

In this example, the `HealthcareSecurityConfig` class demonstrates advanced security configuration for a healthcare application.

## Conclusion

Advanced security configuration techniques offer the flexibility and customization needed to handle complex security scenarios. By defining custom security configuration classes, extending `SecurityConfigurerAdapter` for advanced cases, and combining multiple authentication providers, developers can ensure their applications meet specific security requirements. The example showcased advanced security configuration in a healthcare application, highlighting multi-factor authentication and tailored security settings. As we continue exploring Spring Boot security, the next chapter will focus on securing sensitive data using Encryption and Decryption techniques.
