# Chapter 15: Deployment and Containerization

## Introduction

In the dynamic landscape of software development, the journey doesn't end with coding; it extends to deploying applications and ensuring their seamless execution in various environments. This chapter delves into the intricacies of deploying Spring Boot applications and harnessing the power of containerization to streamline the deployment process. We will walk you through packaging Spring Boot applications, deploying them to popular servlet containers like Tomcat, Jetty, and Undertow, and unveil the magic of containerization using Docker. By immersing yourself in this comprehensive guide, you'll acquire the expertise needed to deploy and manage Spring Boot applications effectively, with real-world examples to illustrate key concepts.

## **Section 1:** Packaging Spring Boot Applications

### The Art and Science of Packaging

Packaging Spring Boot applications is akin to creating a portable ecosystem, ensuring that your application runs seamlessly across different environments.

#### **1. Understanding Packaging Options: JAR vs. WAR:** 

When it comes to packaging, Spring Boot offers two primary options: packaging your application as a JAR (Java Archive) or a WAR (Web Application Archive). The choice depends on your deployment target and the nature of your application.

#### **2. Building Packaged Artifacts with Build Tools: Maven and Gradle:**

Both Maven and Gradle offer plugins that simplify the packaging process. By configuring these plugins, you can effortlessly build deployment-ready artifacts.

```xml
<!-- Maven Example -->
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

## **Section 2:** Deploying to Servlet Containers

### Navigating the Terrain of Servlet Containers

Servlet containers provide the infrastructure for your Spring Boot applications to shine, allowing them to execute consistently in various environments.

#### **1. A Comparative Overview of Servlet Containers: Tomcat, Jetty, and Undertow:**

Spring Boot supports deploying applications to popular servlet containers like Tomcat, Jetty, and Undertow. Each container has its unique strengths, making the choice dependent on factors such as performance, scalability, and ease of configuration.

#### **2. From Packaging to Execution: Deploying Your Spring Boot Application:**

Deploying your Spring Boot application involves packaging it into a deployable artifact and configuring the servlet container to run it. Spring Boot's embedded container capabilities simplify this process, enabling you to launch applications with minimal configuration.

## **Section 3:** Containerization with Docker

### Unleashing the Power of Containers

Containerization with Docker revolutionizes deployment by packaging applications and their dependencies into portable, isolated units.

#### **1. The Docker Approach: Applications as Containers:**

Docker enables you to encapsulate your Spring Boot application, along with its runtime environment and dependencies, into a single container image. This image can then be deployed consistently across different environments, mitigating the dreaded "it works on my machine" syndrome.

#### **2. Crafting Docker Images with Dockerfiles:**

Creating Docker images involves crafting Dockerfiles â€“ scripts that define the steps required to build an image. You can specify the base image, copy application files, and configure the container, resulting in an image tailored to your application's unique requirements.

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile Example
FROM openjdk:11-jre-slim
COPY target/myapp.jar /app.jar
CMD ["java", "-jar", "/app.jar"]
```
