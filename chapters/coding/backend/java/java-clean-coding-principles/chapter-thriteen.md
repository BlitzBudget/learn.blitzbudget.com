## **Chapter 13: Clean Coding in Java 17**

Welcome to a captivating exploration of clean coding in the dynamic landscape of Java 17—a version of the language that showcases the latest language enhancements while upholding the principles of clean coding. In this chapter, we'll embark on a journey to apply clean code practices in Java 17, leveraging its cutting-edge features while prioritizing readability, maintainability, and adherence to clean coding principles. By the end of this chapter, you'll be well-equipped to craft code that not only capitalizes on the advancements of Java 17 but also embodies the elegance and clarity of clean coding.

### **Introduction to Clean Coding in Java 17**

Java 17 introduces exciting features and enhancements that streamline development and improve code quality. Despite these innovations, the essence of clean coding remains paramount. In this chapter, we'll delve into how you can harness the capabilities of Java 17 while adhering to clean coding practices, resulting in code that is not only innovative but also well-structured and maintainable.

### **Streamlining Code with Pattern Matching for switch**

Java 17 introduces pattern matching for the `switch` statement, enabling concise and readable code that elegantly handles different cases.

```java
// Java 17
public class GradeEvaluator {
    public String evaluateGrade(int score) {
        return switch (score) {
            case 90 -> "A";
            case 80 -> "B";
            case 70 -> "C";
            default -> "D";
        };
    }
}
```

### **Maintaining Clarity with `sealed` and `non-sealed` Classes**

The introduction of `sealed` and `non-sealed` classes in Java 17 enhances code clarity by specifying which classes can extend a given class or interface.

```java
// Java 17
public abstract sealed class Shape permits Circle, Rectangle {
    // Common behavior for shapes
}

// Java 17
public final class Circle extends Shape {
    // Implementation of Circle
}

// Java 17
public non-sealed class SpecialRectangle extends Shape {
    // Implementation of SpecialRectangle
}
```

### **Embracing Records for Structured Data**

Records, introduced in Java 14 and refined in subsequent versions, offer a concise way to define classes for storing and transporting data, further enhancing code readability.

```java
// Java 17
public record Person(String firstName, String lastName, int age) {
    // Implicitly defined constructor, equals(), hashCode(), and toString()
}
```

### **Applying Clean Code Principles with Java 17 Features**

Java 17's advancements align seamlessly with clean coding principles. Leverage the enhanced features while adhering to meaningful naming, effective commenting, and the core principles of clean coding.

```java
// Java 17
public interface Shape {
    double calculateArea();
}

public class Circle implements Shape {
    public double calculateArea() {
        // Implement calculateArea for circles
    }
}
```

### **Conclusion**

In this chapter, you've embarked on a voyage through the realm of clean coding in the context of Java 17—a version of the language that introduces powerful features and enhancements. By embracing pattern matching for `switch` statements, utilizing `sealed` and `non-sealed` classes, and leveraging records for structured data, you're unlocking the potential to create code that is both advanced and architecturally sound. Clean coding principles remain steadfast, enabling you to produce Java 17 code that is not only aligned with the latest language features but also embodies the qualities of readability, maintainability, and elegance. As you continue your journey, you'll discover more strategies to craft code that showcases the synergy between innovation and clean coding principles, elevating the quality of your software projects.
