# Chapter 1: Introduction to GitHub Actions: Automating Your Workflows

## Overview

GitHub Actions is a powerful automation platform provided by GitHub that enables you to create custom workflows for your software development projects. With GitHub Actions, you can automate various tasks, such as building, testing, and deploying your code, and integrate them directly into your GitHub repository. In this chapter, we'll introduce you to GitHub Actions and show you how to get started with creating workflows using YAML examples.

## What are GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions are customizable units of work that you can define in your repository to automatically build, test, and deploy your code. Each action is a set of one or more jobs, and each job is a sequence of steps that execute commands on your virtual environment. GitHub Actions provides a vast library of pre-built actions, or you can create your own custom actions to suit your project's specific needs.

## Setting Up a Workflow

To create a workflow, you need to define a YAML file called `workflow.yml` inside a `.github/workflows` directory in your GitHub repository. The YAML file contains the instructions for GitHub Actions to execute the desired tasks. Let's look at a basic example:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Build and Test
      run: |
        npm install
        npm run build
        npm test
```

In this example, we define a workflow called "CI" that runs whenever there is a push event to the "main" branch. The workflow consists of a single job called "build" that runs on an `ubuntu-latest` virtual environment. The steps include checking out the repository, installing dependencies, building the code, and running tests.

## Triggering Workflows

GitHub Actions workflows can be triggered by various events, such as pushes, pull requests, or manual triggers. You can customize the `on` keyword in the YAML file to specify when the workflow should run. For example:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - feature/*
  workflow_dispatch:
```

In this modified example, the workflow will run on pushes to the "main" branch, pull requests targeting "feature/" branches, and when manually triggered using the GitHub UI with the "workflow_dispatch" event.

## Reusing Actions

One of the key benefits of GitHub Actions is the ability to reuse existing actions from the GitHub Marketplace or other repositories. You can incorporate these actions into your workflows using the `uses` keyword. For example:

```yaml
steps:
- name: Checkout code
  uses: actions/checkout@v2

- name: Build and Test
  uses: actions/setup-node@v2
  with:
    node-version: '14'
- run: |
    npm install
    npm run build
    npm test
```

In this example, we are using the `actions/setup-node` action to set up the Node.js environment before building and testing the code.

## Conclusion

In this chapter, we introduced you to GitHub Actions and showed you how to get started with creating workflows using YAML examples. GitHub Actions allow you to automate your software development processes and streamline your CI/CD workflows directly from your GitHub repository.

You can define workflows using YAML syntax, trigger them based on various events, and reuse existing actions to perform common tasks. As you become more familiar with GitHub Actions, you can explore advanced features and customize your workflows to suit the unique requirements of your projects.

In the next chapters, we'll dive deeper into specific GitHub Actions use cases, including building and deploying applications to AWS, automating tests, and integrating with other third-party services.
