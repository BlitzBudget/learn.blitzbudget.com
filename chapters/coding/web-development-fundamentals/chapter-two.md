## Chapter 2: Understanding HTML Basics

In this chapter, we'll dive into the core of web development - HTML. HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language, is the fundamental language used to create the structure and content of a web page. Let's explore the basics of HTML and get you started on your web development journey.

### Anatomy of an HTML Document

A typical HTML document consists of the following elements:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Your Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your content goes here -->
</body>
</html>
```

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This declaration specifies the document type and version. Always use it at the beginning of your HTML document.

- `<html>`: The root element of an HTML document. All other elements are nested within this element.

- `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the document, such as the title, external stylesheets, and scripts.

- `<title>`: Sets the title of the web page, which appears in the browser's title bar or tab.

- `<body>`: This element contains the visible content of your web page, including text, images, links, and other elements.

### HTML Elements and Tags

HTML elements are the building blocks of a web page. Each element is represented by a pair of tags, consisting of an opening tag and a closing tag. Here are some common HTML elements:

- `<h1>` to `<h6>`: Headings, where `h1` represents the highest level and `h6` the lowest.

- `<p>`: Paragraphs, used for organizing text content.

- `<a>`: Anchors or hyperlinks, linking to other web pages or resources.

- `<img>`: Images, displaying visual content on the web page.

- `<ul>` and `<ol>`: Unordered and ordered lists, respectively.

- `<li>`: List items within a list.

### Adding Structure with HTML Semantics

HTML provides semantic elements that give meaning and structure to the content. Some essential semantic elements include:

- `<header>`: Represents the header section of a web page or a specific section.

- `<nav>`: Defines the navigation links of a page.

- `<main>`: Represents the main content area of a web page.

- `<section>`: Represents a thematic grouping of content.

- `<article>`: Represents a self-contained piece of content, such as a blog post.

- `<footer>`: Defines the footer section of a web page.

### Creating Your First HTML Page

To create your first HTML page, follow these steps:

1. Open a text editor or code editor of your choice.

2. Type the basic structure of an HTML document as shown earlier.

3. Add some content inside the `<body>` tags.

4. Save the file with an `.html` extension (e.g., `index.html`).

5. Open the HTML file in your web browser to view the page.

Congratulations! You've taken your first steps into the world of HTML. In the next chapter, we'll explore CSS and learn how to style and design your web pages to make them visually appealing and user-friendly.
