## Chapter 16: Introduction to Version Control with Git

In this chapter, we'll explore the fundamental concepts of version control using Git, a widely used distributed version control system. Git is an essential tool for web developers to track changes, collaborate with teams, and manage code repositories efficiently.

### What is Version Control?

Version control is a system that tracks changes made to files over time. It allows developers to manage different versions of their code, revert to previous states, and collaborate with others seamlessly.

### Introduction to Git

#### What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system designed for speed, efficiency, and collaboration. It allows developers to work on projects locally and synchronize changes with a remote repository.

#### Key Features of Git

- **Branching and Merging:** Git allows developers to create branches to work on new features or fixes without affecting the main codebase. Merging branches later combines the changes.

- **History Tracking:** Git maintains a detailed history of all changes made to files, providing a comprehensive audit trail.

- **Collaboration:** Git enables multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously and merge their changes seamlessly.

### Basic Git Workflow

#### 1. Initializing a Git Repository

To start using Git in your project, navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
git init
```

#### 2. Adding and Committing Changes

After making changes to your files, stage them for the commit using:

```bash
git add <file(s)>
```

Then, commit the changes with a descriptive message:

```bash
git commit -m "Add new feature"
```

#### 3. Viewing Repository Status

Check the status of your repository to see the changes and staged files:

```bash
git status
```

#### 4. Creating and Switching Branches

Create a new branch to work on a new feature or bug fix:

```bash
git checkout -b new-feature
```

Switch between branches using:

```bash
git checkout <branch-name>
```

#### 5. Merging Branches

Merge changes from one branch into another:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge new-feature
```

### Remote Repositories and Collaboration

#### 1. Cloning a Remote Repository

To clone an existing repository from a remote server, use:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

#### 2. Pushing and Pulling Changes

Push local changes to the remote repository:

```bash
git push origin main
```

Pull changes from the remote repository to update your local codebase:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

### Conclusion

Git is a powerful version control system that enhances collaboration, helps manage code versions, and ensures the integrity of your web development projects. Understanding Git basics is crucial for effective teamwork and project management.
