## Chapter 3: Building the Backend Service

In this chapter, we will dive into the process of designing and building the backend service that will be deployed to the AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service) using a GitHub Workflow. We'll cover the design of APIs, implementing business logic, and containerizing the backend service to ensure compatibility with ECS.

### Designing the Backend Service: APIs and Business Logic

#### API Design Principles

When designing APIs for your backend service, it's important to follow best practices that ensure security, scalability, and ease of use. Here are some key principles to consider:

1. **RESTful Principles**: Embrace the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST). Design resources as nouns, use HTTP methods for actions (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and provide meaningful URLs.

2. **Versioning**: Include version numbers in your API endpoints to ensure backward compatibility as your API evolves.

3. **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement secure authentication mechanisms such as OAuth 2.0 or JWT, and enforce proper authorization to control access to different parts of your API.

4. **Error Handling**: Define clear error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages. Provide helpful information to clients for debugging.

5. **Input Validation**: Validate input data to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.

6. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive API documentation using tools like OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) to make it easy for developers to understand and use your APIs.

#### Implementing Business Logic

The business logic of your backend service encompasses the core functionalities that your application provides. This could involve processing requests, interacting with databases, performing calculations, and more. Here's a step-by-step process for implementing business logic:

1. **Identify Use Cases**: Understand the use cases and functionalities your application needs to support. This includes user registration, authentication, data retrieval, modification, and any other specific requirements.

2. **Modularize Code**: Break down your application into modules or services. Each module should handle a specific set of functionalities, promoting code organization and maintainability.

3. **Database Interaction**: Implement database interactions using ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) frameworks or direct query execution. Ensure data is fetched securely and without exposing sensitive information.

4. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling to gracefully handle exceptions and failures. Provide meaningful error messages that help users and developers understand what went wrong.

5. **Unit Testing**: Write unit tests for each component of your business logic. This helps catch bugs early and ensures that your logic works as expected.

6. **Logging**: Implement proper logging to track the flow of your business logic and troubleshoot issues efficiently.

### Containerizing the Backend Service for ECS

Containerization plays a crucial role in deploying applications to AWS ECS. Containers package the application code, libraries, and dependencies, ensuring consistent behavior across different environments. Here's how to containerize your backend service:

1. **Dockerize Your Application**: Create a Dockerfile that defines the environment, dependencies, and setup needed to run your backend service. Use a base image that suits your technology stack.

2. **Build the Docker Image**: Use the `docker build` command to build the Docker image from the Dockerfile. This process creates an image containing your application code and runtime environment.

3. **Push to Container Registry**: If you're using Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry), push the Docker image to your registry. This step is crucial as ECS will pull the image from the registry during deployment.

4. **Task Definition**: In your ECS task definition, specify the Docker image from your ECR repository. Define the necessary resources and configurations for your container.

5. **Service Deployment**: Create an ECS service that references your task definition. This service manages the deployment and scaling of your containers across the ECS cluster.

### Example: Creating an Express.js Backend Service

Let's walk through an example of building a simple Express.js backend service and containerizing it for ECS.

1. **API Design**: Define routes for user registration, login, and fetching data. Implement authentication middleware to secure routes.

2. **Business Logic**: Implement user registration and login using a database (e.g., PostgreSQL). Hash passwords before storing them.

3. **Dockerfile**: Create a Dockerfile that starts with the official Node.js image. Copy your application files, install dependencies, and expose the appropriate port.

4. **Build Docker Image**: Run `docker build -t my-backend-service .` to build the Docker image.

5. **Push to ECR**: Tag the image with the ECR repository URI and push it to ECR.

6. **ECS Task Definition**: Create an ECS task definition with the ECR image URI, memory, CPU, and any environment variables.

7. **ECS Service**: Create an ECS service that uses the task definition. Configure the desired number of tasks, load balancer, and security groups.

By following these steps, you can build, containerize, and deploy a secure backend service using AWS ECS and GitHub Workflow. This aligns with the architecture description outlined in the previous chapters, focusing on security and authenticated user access.

### AWS CloudFormation Example

```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Resources:
  MyECSCluster:
    Type: AWS::ECS::Cluster
    Properties:
      ClusterName: my-ecs-cluster

  MyECSTaskDefinition:
    Type: AWS::ECS::TaskDefinition
    Properties:
      Family: my-backend-service
      ContainerDefinitions:
        - Name: my-backend-container
          Image: your-ecr-repo-uri:latest
          Memory: 512
          PortMappings:
            - ContainerPort: 80

  MyECSService:
    Type: AWS::ECS::Service
    Properties:
      Cluster: !Ref MyECSCluster
      TaskDefinition: !Ref MyECSTaskDefinition
      DesiredCount: 2
```

### AWS CDK Example (in TypeScript)

```typescript
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import * as ecs from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-ecs';

class MyEcsStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const cluster = new ecs.Cluster(this, 'MyEcsCluster', {
      clusterName: 'my-ecs-cluster',
    });

    const taskDefinition = new ecs.TaskDefinition(this, 'MyEcsTaskDefinition', {
      family: 'my-backend-service',
    });

    const container = taskDefinition.addContainer('MyBackendContainer', {
      image: 'your-ecr-repo-uri:latest',
      memoryLimitMiB: 512,
    });

    container.addPortMappings({
      containerPort: 80,
    });

    new ecs.FargateService(this, 'MyEcsService', {
      cluster,
      taskDefinition,
      desiredCount: 2,
    });
  }
}

const app = new cdk.App();
new MyEcsStack(app, 'MyEcsStack');
```

Both examples illustrate how to create an ECS cluster, task definition, and service using either AWS CloudFormation or AWS CDK. The containerized backend service is defined with its image, memory, and port mappings. Adjust the configuration to match your specific use case and requirements.
