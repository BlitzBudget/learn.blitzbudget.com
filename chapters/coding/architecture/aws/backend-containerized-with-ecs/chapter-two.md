# **Chapter 2: Designing a Private VPC for Isolated Environments**

In this chapter, we'll dive into the process of creating a private Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to establish isolated environments for the various tiers of your multi-tier architecture. By isolating your components within private subnets, you enhance the security and control of your architecture. We'll delve into subnet design, routing tables, and network access control to ensure the integrity of your VPC.

**Subnet Design for Isolation**

A crucial aspect of designing a private VPC is the subdivision of your network into isolated subnets. Each subnet resides in a specific availability zone and can be designated as either public or private. Public subnets are associated with a route table that directs traffic to an Internet Gateway (IGW), allowing instances within the subnet to communicate with the internet. On the other hand, private subnets are associated with a route table that routes traffic to a Network Address Translation (NAT) Gateway, enabling instances within the subnet to initiate outbound requests to the internet while remaining inaccessible from the outside.

**Routing Tables and Network Access Control**

Routing tables play a pivotal role in controlling how traffic flows within your VPC. In a private VPC setup, you'll configure routing tables to ensure that instances in private subnets can communicate with each other and with necessary external services, while maintaining a high level of isolation from the public internet. Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) provide an additional layer of security by controlling inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level. NACLs allow you to define rules that explicitly permit or deny traffic based on IP addresses and port ranges.

**CDK Example: Private VPC Creation**

Let's take a hands-on approach to creating a private VPC using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK). The following CDK template demonstrates the creation of a private VPC with two private subnets across two availability zones.

```typescript
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { Stack, StackProps } from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import * as ec2 from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-ec2';

export class PrivateVpcStack extends Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.Construct, id: string, props?: StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    // Create a VPC with two private subnets
    const vpc = new ec2.Vpc(this, 'MyVpc', {
      maxAzs: 2,
      subnetConfiguration: [
        {
          name: 'PrivateSubnet1',
          subnetType: ec2.SubnetType.PRIVATE,
        },
        {
          name: 'PrivateSubnet2',
          subnetType: ec2.SubnetType.PRIVATE,
        },
      ],
    });

    // Output the VPC ID
    new cdk.CfnOutput(this, 'VpcIdOutput', {
      value: vpc.vpcId,
    });
  }
}

const app = new cdk.App();
new PrivateVpcStack(app, 'PrivateVpcStack');
```

This example showcases the creation of a private VPC with private subnets using the CDK. The subsequent chapters will expand on this foundation by adding more layers to your architecture and securing them with appropriate measures.

In the upcoming chapters, we will continue building on this private VPC by adding various components like network load balancers, ECS clusters, EC2 instances, databases, and more. Our aim is to create a comprehensive multi-tier architecture that adheres to best practices in security and isolation.

Creating a comprehensive CDK stack with complete security configurations and a multi-tier architecture is quite extensive. However, we can provide you with a simplified example that includes various security measures while covering a multi-tier architecture using Amazon VPC, EC2, ECS, RDS, and other AWS services. Please note that this example serves as a starting point, and you should further customize it based on your specific requirements and security needs.

```typescript
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { Stack, StackProps } from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import * as ec2 from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-ec2';
import * as ecs from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-ecs';
import * as rds from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-rds';

export class SecureMultiTierArchitectureStack extends Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.Construct, id: string, props?: StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    // Create a VPC
    const vpc = new ec2.Vpc(this, 'MyVpc', {
      maxAzs: 2,
      subnetConfiguration: [
        {
          name: 'PublicSubnet',
          subnetType: ec2.SubnetType.PUBLIC,
        },
        {
          name: 'PrivateSubnet',
          subnetType: ec2.SubnetType.PRIVATE,
        },
      ],
    });

    // Create a security group for RDS
    const rdsSecurityGroup = new ec2.SecurityGroup(this, 'RdsSecurityGroup', {
      vpc,
      allowAllOutbound: true,
    });
    rdsSecurityGroup.addIngressRule(ec2.Peer.anyIpv4(), ec2.Port.tcp(5432));

    // Create RDS instance in private subnet
    const rdsInstance = new rds.DatabaseInstance(this, 'MyRdsInstance', {
      engine: rds.DatabaseInstanceEngine.postgres({
        version: rds.PostgresEngineVersion.VER_13,
      }),
      instanceType: ec2.InstanceType.of(ec2.InstanceClass.BURSTABLE2, ec2.InstanceSize.MICRO),
      vpc,
      securityGroups: [rdsSecurityGroup],
    });

    // Create an ECS cluster in private subnet
    const cluster = new ecs.Cluster(this, 'MyEcsCluster', {
      vpc,
    });

    // Output the RDS endpoint and ECS cluster name
    new cdk.CfnOutput(this, 'RdsEndpointOutput', {
      value: rdsInstance.dbInstanceEndpointAddress,
    });
    new cdk.CfnOutput(this, 'EcsClusterNameOutput', {
      value: cluster.clusterName,
    });
  }
}

const app = new cdk.App();
new SecureMultiTierArchitectureStack(app, 'SecureMultiTierArchitectureStack');
```

This example demonstrates the creation of a secure multi-tier architecture using the AWS CDK. It includes the creation of a VPC, private and public subnets, an RDS instance in the private subnet, and an ECS cluster in the private subnet. It also configures a security group for RDS and sets up proper networking and security measures.

Please note that this example focuses on the foundational structure and security configurations. In a real-world scenario, you would need to enhance security further with encryption, access controls, IAM roles, and more, according to your specific requirements. Additionally, this example does not cover all the components you mentioned (like NLB, VPN, API Gateway, Route 53, etc.), as it's a simplified starting point.
