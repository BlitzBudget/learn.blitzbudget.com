## Chapter 16: Setting Up Authorization and Authentication for API Gateway

In this chapter, we'll explore how to implement authorization and authentication mechanisms for your Amazon API Gateway. Securing your API endpoints is crucial to ensure that only authorized users or applications can access your resources. We'll focus on using API keys as an authentication method to control access to the API endpoints.

### Introduction to API Gateway Authorization and Authentication

Amazon API Gateway provides several mechanisms to control and restrict access to your APIs, including API keys, IAM roles, Lambda authorizers, and OAuth 2.0 integration. For this example, we'll cover the use of API keys, which are simple credentials that can be included in API requests to identify the calling application.

### CDK Template Explanation

Let's walk through the CDK template provided above:

1. Import Required Modules: The CDK template starts by importing the necessary modules from the AWS CDK library.

2. Create an API Gateway: We create an instance of `apigateway.RestApi` to define our API. We set up deployment options such as logging level and data trace.

3. Create an API Key: The `apigateway.ApiKey` resource is created to generate an API key. This API key will be required for authorized access to specific API methods.

4. Create an API Gateway Resource: We define a resource under the root of our API using `api.root.addResource('my-resource')`. This resource represents the endpoint we want to secure.

5. Add Method with API Key Authorization: We use the `resource.addMethod` method to add an HTTP method to our resource. We set `apiKeyRequired` to `true`, indicating that the API key is required to access this method. We also provide an HTTP integration to define where the API Gateway will forward the requests.

### CloudFormation Template Explanation

Here's the CloudFormation equivalent of the CDK template:

1. Create API Gateway and API Key: We create an API Gateway using `AWS::ApiGateway::RestApi` and an API key using `AWS::ApiGateway::ApiKey`.

2. Define API Resource: We create an API resource using `AWS::ApiGateway::Resource`. This resource corresponds to the endpoint we want to secure.

3. Add Method with API Key Authorization: We define a method using `AWS::ApiGateway::Method` and set `AuthorizationType` to `API_KEY`. This enforces the requirement for an API key to access the method.

4. Integration Configuration: We define the integration type (`HTTP`) and the integration HTTP method (`GET`). We also specify the URI where the requests will be forwarded (`https://example.com`).

### Conclusion

By following the provided CDK and CloudFormation templates, you can easily set up API key authorization for your Amazon API Gateway. This ensures that only requests with valid API keys can access the protected endpoints of your API. Remember that while API keys are a simple way to control access, more advanced authentication methods are available for more complex security requirements. Always evaluate your application's security needs and choose the appropriate authentication mechanism accordingly.

### CDK Template

```typescript
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import * as apigateway from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-apigateway';

class ApiGatewayAuthStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    // Create an API Gateway
    const api = new apigateway.RestApi(this, 'MyApi', {
      deployOptions: {
        loggingLevel: apigateway.MethodLoggingLevel.INFO,
        dataTraceEnabled: true,
      },
    });

    // Create an API key
    const apiKey = new apigateway.ApiKey(this, 'MyApiKey');

    // Create an API Gateway resource
    const resource = api.root.addResource('my-resource');

    // Add a method with API key authorization
    resource.addMethod('GET', new apigateway.HttpIntegration('https://example.com'), {
      apiKeyRequired: true,
    });
  }
}

const app = new cdk.App();
new ApiGatewayAuthStack(app, 'ApiGatewayAuthStack');
```

### CloudFormation Template

```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Resources:
  MyApi:
    Type: AWS::ApiGateway::RestApi
    Properties:
      Name: MyApi
      FailOnWarnings: true
  MyApiKey:
    Type: AWS::ApiGateway::ApiKey
    Properties:
      Name: MyApiKey
      Enabled: true
  MyApiResource:
    Type: AWS::ApiGateway::Resource
    Properties:
      ParentId: !GetAtt MyApi.RootResourceId
      PathPart: my-resource
      RestApiId: !Ref MyApi
  MyApiMethod:
    Type: AWS::ApiGateway::Method
    Properties:
      AuthorizationType: API_KEY
      ApiKeyRequired: true
      HttpMethod: GET
      ResourceId: !Ref MyApiResource
      RestApiId: !Ref MyApi
      Integration:
        Type: HTTP
        IntegrationHttpMethod: GET
        Uri: 'https://example.com'
Outputs:
  ApiGatewayId:
    Value:
      Ref: MyApi
```

These templates demonstrate how to set up authorization and authentication for API Gateway using API keys. You can extend the examples by integrating other authentication methods like IAM roles, Lambda authorizers, or OAuth 2.0.

Remember to customize the templates to match your specific use case and requirements. Additionally, ensure that you follow best practices for securing your APIs and managing access to sensitive resources.
