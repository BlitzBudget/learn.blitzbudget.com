                            <p>
                                Unfortunately, the way we think about something also seems
                                to affect our ability to earn. These are the ideological constraints that we impose upon
                                ourselves because we feel like we are a part of some group identity.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                In India it could be caste, In western countries, the foreign population are usually
                                grouped by country and if the foreign population has stayed in the same country for
                                hundreds of years then it becomes blacks vs whites like in the US. What is more
                                problematic is when other identities try to impose a certain type of behaviour on other
                                minority identities.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The growing trend in India under the Modi government's rule in India is the systemic
                                neglect by the government of the injustices committed against the Muslim minorities.
                                When people target them and try to destroy their lively hood. It just seems unfair at
                                times. It also happens in China when they try to reeducate the minority population there
                                to become a communist and integrate them with the other religion less majority.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It is just that if we destroy god and religion for most people, politics becomes their
                                identity and people simply start assuming that identity and denigrate other identities
                                or at least try to prove that the other identity is much lower than theirs. The more I
                                research the more I am convinced that a deep part of the human brain is involved in
                                segregating the people that we see into groups. When we do that we easily identify them
                                and understand them.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                If you are an Indian reading this and I say Congress party in India, It is synonymous
                                with Corruption. When I say BJP, it is synonymous with Hindu promoting party. Like it or
                                not people just assume an identity and start working towards it. Even when the Congress
                                party had no identity other than for the people by the people, We created an identity
                                for them as a corrupt government which does nothing but eat the taxpayer's money. They
                                rule India continuously for the first 30 years. If at all Gandhi had lived, India today
                                would have been a much different place to live. Now we are just left with nepotism, a
                                Corrupt elite who has the money to buy whole islands and create a country of their own
                                and people like Vijay Mallya who simply seem to have no ounce of morality or dignity,
                                They just steal from the banks and run away with all the money.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Who cares about them right? I am a human being who deserves to be treated with respect
                                and the dignity I deserve. Well, human, people would not treat you with respect if you
                                do not treat them back with equal respect and the more power you have the more
                                responsibility that you have to ensure that you treat people appropriately. It is also
                                true that we become more biased as we have more power.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Because we just start seeing the ones who are more like us around us so much that we
                                feel like everybody is rich. And then comes political ideologies like Communism which
                                ensured that around 100 million people died as a direct result of communist governments
                                in Russia and China in the 1950s. They help us convince that ideas taken too far can be
                                extremely dangerous. It has the potential to wipe out our entire population in a
                                generation.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It seems completely unfair to use communism as an example. Let us also use capitalism.
                                Let us see capitalism and consumerism. As a result of which we are turning our earth
                                into dessert and every day more hectares of land into wastelands and polluted spaces and
                                oceans. It just seems like we cannot push any idea to its extreme, everything is in
                                moderation. Like, have a capitalistic economy under a communist government inside a
                                democratic system.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                While every system, ideologies have its failure. We can combine the principles of each
                                and improve people's lives as they have done beautifully in Europe. integrating the best
                                of both worlds in Europe. Communism and Capital, thus providing free health care system
                                and free education to everyone. Along with home loans in under 1% interest rates. Who
                                would have imagined man? The last time I checked the interest rates it was around 8% in
                                India for taking home loans and they were for a span of 15 to 30 years. With such a
                                high-interest rate we just pay 2X for every 10 years. It is simply unsustainable levels
                                of interest rates and greed that make the already struggling middle class much poorer
                                and the rich super-rich in India. And the absence of such systems which keep the middle
                                class dignified in Europe. It is the single biggest success by far that European nations
                                have produced.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                So if it is just about earning money that matters in our lives I believe, it is also how
                                well we can live our lives that also matter. Simply having more money just feels
                                promising and it might also seem like a cure for every problem but money can only make
                                you a bigger person. If you are a prick you are just a bigger prick now. Well, That
                                doesn't help anybody, does it? Society is already struggling with enough troublemakers
                                as it is.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Who needs a bigger and fatter pig who just denigrates rather than constructively
                                contributes to society. I have just left being socially and politically correct. it has
                                its uses but I guess just not here. As long as you take away the point mentioned here.
                                It's a win for me.
