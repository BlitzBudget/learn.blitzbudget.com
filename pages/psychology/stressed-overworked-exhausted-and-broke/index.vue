                                this will exactly be the outcome when you try to
                                do something that does not make you happy. Our circumstances around us play an
                                increasingly predominant role in ensuring what we could be focused on and what we want
                                to spend our time on. What happens when cannot spend our time with our loved ones and
                                are denied holidays to go on a much-needed vacation but are asked to work or quit the
                                job.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Unfortunately, it is the sad truth in the majority of the countries where paid vacation
                                simply does not guarantee that you could enjoy those days. Unlike a few countries like
                                Europe, people are expected to put in more hours and they are the ones who are
                                eventually promoted through the corporate ladder. Such environments are where stress and
                                overworked, exhaustion are rampant. I have even heard stories where people take pills to
                                keep themselves going and they end up hospitalized for like a month and then it hits
                                them that not everything in life is about money and they quit for like a month or two to
                                take a much-needed vacation to come back and go to a lower-paying job which provides a
                                better work-life balance in life.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Only if we are all happy with our existing life we can even comprehend to aim higher in
                                life to achieve what we want to achieve else we would just be bogged down by the sheer
                                wait for everyday stress and exhaustion that it could just want us to focus one bloody
                                damn day at a time. If you are in that bucket then know this. Something in your life is
                                making you stressed and trapped. It is often these people that also feel trapped by the
                                way that there is no exit and they would have to keep doing what they do if not! They
                                would lose the meagre things that they already have and be thrown into a world where
                                they have nothing, absolutely nothing.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                When you are in those times, you will truly understand who was true to you and who was
                                just hanging around just because they could suck a little more from you. They are the
                                ones that leave you as soon as you become vulnerable and helpless. Once you get through
                                that shit and come back up. As you will always do, it will only make you stronger and
                                better making you capable of handling a lot of shit and keeping you calm all the way
                                through.

                                Everyone wants to have the life of a millionaire but no one wants to bear the
                                consequences that come along with being a millionaire. The age-old knowledge that the
                                lottery winners lose everything that they had earned in 5 years comes to mind. It is you
                                who is responsible for keeping you poor, stressed and broke. No one else in this world
                                is responsible for it not the oligarchs unless you are born in countries like Russia
                                that are willingly keeping you poor.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                We are so fortunate in a lot of sense to not be born in North Korea or Russia or even be
                                born in this generation at this age and time where we are the most comfortable people to
                                be ever alive in the history of mankind and bitch about life not being fair on the
                                internet while eating pizza ordered from Just Eat.

                                People have it, tough man, 805 of Niger is just dessert. so they don't even have food to
                                go about. They had to prevent the expansion of dessert and start from there. forget
                                internet and food delivery apps. They still like in huts. In the 21st century! It seems
                                that absolute poverty would be completely abolished by the end of 2050 but we are still
                                stressed, overworked, exhausted and broke.

                                When you go into debt to buy the shit that you do not need to impress your neighbour who
                                doesn't give a shit about you nor care about you is just pointless voluntary suffering
                                and as a result, if you have to work for 12 hours every day to just get paid to have a
                                roof over your house. That's your Karma bitch! Find a way to get out of that mess.
                                Follow David Bach or Dave Ramsey and use their strategy to get out of the mess that you
                                had created and Volla, You would find yourself in paradise.

                                Life already has too much suffering in place for us that it is just meaning less to be
                                too shortsighted and live in the now. some of us are not even privileged enough to make
                                a single mistake in our lives yet are stressed, exhausted, overworked and poor. If you
                                are in that bucket, I am so sorry for you man. I know people like that are not there
                                because of their choice but because that was the only option for them and the other
                                being homelessness and death.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                If you are doing that right now then rest assured that your next generation does not
                                have to go through what you are going through and every day is going to get much easier
                                to navigate that the previous day, every day more bearable than the previous. take it
                                one day at a time. Make it your life's ambition to ensure that by the time you retire
                                you have enough saved that you need not worry about that ever again in your life.
                                Neither you nor your loved ones EVER!
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                And that would have to be your only aim in life! Aim as high as you possibly can and
                                reach that place so you wouldn't;t have to suffer. You suffer now so you do not have to
                                tomorrow. We are all with you on this journey.
