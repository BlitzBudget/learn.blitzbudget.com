              <p>
                who would not shy away from saying white lies as long as we get
                what we want/prevent bad things from happening by telling the
                truth (which just means you did something that would negatively
                impact you and/or others if the truth comes out ) then you would
                notice that even if we get away till now, we are paying a price.
                <br />
                <br />
                We convince ourselves every time we tell a lie and get away with
                it that we can do a small thing (a bad thing) and get away with
                it by lying. What we are essentially doing is manipulating the
                circumstances and trying to bend reality to serve us in some way
                or the other!
                <br />
                <br />
                Manipulating the reality to serve you may seem enticing for now
                but it is always better to pay the price today than to pay the
                price with compounded interest tomorrow.
                <br />
                <br />
                How many times have we heard a story about what happens when a
                married man cheats on his wife without her knowing for months?
                It almost always ends with a divorce/breakup in the case of
                couples.
                <br />
                <br />
                I have always asked myself why is it? Is that not just a mistake
                when a person chooses to have a one-night stand with someone
                else and hides it from his partner? And once she realizes it,
                later on, she would be hurt by it of course! but would
                eventually forgive him because the good he has done so far
                outweighs this one mistake.
                <br />
                <br />
                Haha! I was just naive to think about it coming to think about
                it. I did not know one critical point before then.
                <br />
                <br />
              </p>
              <p class="blockquote blockquote-primary">
                “A lie becomes a betrayal when kept a secret!”

                This one point changed everything for me! But it still did not
                explain to me how not telling the truth could be perceived as a
                lie. The lie of omission is a greater sin than a lie of
                commission according to Jordan Peterson. It did not make sense
                to me how that could be so!
                <br />
                <br />
                It makes sense in a way now coming to think about it! When you
                miss important information with the full intention of keeping
                the other person in the dark and thus manipulating the
                situation, we are manipulating the truth a bit further,
                stretching the truth a little further and thus it snaps back at
                us with a higher intensity than the lie of commission because
                the lie of the commission includes false information in place
                instead of omitting it completely thus just twisting the truth
                to serve the person telling the lie, in other words stretching
                it comparatively a little less than the lie of omission.
                <br />
                <br />
                How so? I haven’t figured it out, yet! Do let me know if you
                know.
                <br />
                <br />
                But the fact remains if you lie you have to pay for it! The
                longer you keep it as a lie the more you pay for it.

              <p>
                The truth always comes out for those who seek.
                <br />
                Let us say that truth never came out. You got away with it. What
                happens then? You got away manipulating the truth. So the likely
                hood of you doing it more in the future increases. Why do people
                lie? To manipulate the circumstances to serve them. Why would
                they manipulate the circumstances and then lie about it? Because
                they would like to <i>have the cake and eat it too!</i>
              </p>
              <p>
                But the manipulation has forever altered their interaction with
                reality. So they see the world as something that can be
                manipulated. So instead of choosing a path, that is very hard
                but truthful to reach a place they would choose to manipulate
                reality to serve them and try not to be burnt by the
                consequences of the manipulation. That is why corruption is bad!
                That is why stealing is bad! That’s why those who steal also
                lie. And those who lie also tend to think that others lie to
                them. And as a matter of fact, choose to think that others lie
                to them because they are trying to manipulate them into getting
                something (forcibly taking something valuable from them forever)
                by manipulation.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is also why those who lie have trust issues. Although that
                is not the only reason people have trust issues. You also do not
                trust someone if you have been hurt by someone thus breaking
                your heart so much so that it is hard to ever trust someone
                else.
              </p>
              <p>
                Let’s say that someone has lied about having a bachelor's degree
                and then bribed the interviewer with the money that they stole
                from their parents to get a job that they have no intention of
                actually putting in the effort necessary. Then they have decided
                to outsource their work to China and just chill out all day
                playing PS5 for the next 6 years. And one fine day, the security
                team finds an unexpected VPN connection from China and digs
                deeper to find out that you have been outsourcing everything for
                the past 6 years, so they choose to dig deeper then find out
                that the degree certificate provided was forged! Moreover, it
                was the responsibility of the interviewer to find out if the
                hired person knew necessary before hiring them, so they find out
                that the interviewer is corrupt and might have been hiring
                people based on the bribe paid to him. What happens??
              </p>
              <p>
                You get fired, the interviewer gets fired, you both get black
                listed and you would be lucky if it ends with black listing!
              </p>
              <p>
                Manipulation, bribing, and stealing are not meant for truth
                seekers! Seek the truth, the path may be hard but it will be
                eternally lasting and never.
