                            <p>
                                the balance in life where no one is pushing too
                                hard and Maybe we are in the middle class staying comfortable where we are at and
                                growing in a very slow phase?
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Honestly, if I had done that the industry that I am in right now would have fired me and
                                I would have probably been jobless right now. When I was working for Carrefour. They
                                just replaced my technology with a brand new one and the whole past 4 years of it would
                                have just become obsolete if I just stocked with my experience and waited for the
                                company to help me grow.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The point to be taken is that I was not even allowed to be in the new project despite
                                the continued effort that I thought I showed. Maybe I lacked something that they wanted.
                                I don’t know. The point here is that I was not among the preferred few who got to work
                                on the new project and felt left behind. And as a direct result, it would have simply
                                been a legacy project maintainer and still if I had just waited for the company to help
                                me grow in a different direction.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                A would have come when they did not need that legacy project and that would have
                                honestly been the end of my IT career forever!!!
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                So maybe just maybe, things might not necessarily be the way they are right now and it
                                might change and at a phase which would require us to not just learn at work but also to
                                learn while we are at home. Maybe like 1 to 2 hours every day after work.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I don’t know man find your balance there. It’s your life set an arbitrary number that
                                you can handle and that your loved ones would allow and go for it.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                If you don’t have enough time to set a few hours for learning take it from the
                                binge-watching time that all do by the way.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                And strive to learn. Even after this if you think you can still take life easy, then not
                                give it a try man! Because it guarantees one thing! Mediocrity!!
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Yes, that’s what it guarantees you would be just the average person who would do the
                                minimum amount of work and learning necessary to ensure that you have work and continue
                                to have work but not enough to grow at a phase which will ensure that you thrive.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I guarantee you that if we go into that phase in 10 or 20 years you would have to change
                                your career and start again. Hopefully, get the same pay but I highly doubt it.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Any field, any field. It just guarantees the same outcome. What if you are in a field
                                that will never be obsolete and guarantees you a job until you turn 65. You are the
                                privileged few who have the right to take it at your phase in life. I truly am happy for
                                you! That is not how life is for the rest of us.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                At least you might know a new perspective and get enlightened. If you are too relaxed in
                                your life and or just unhappy with your life but want to turn it around. This is a good
                                starting point to just thinking about what you are doing and where you are going.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Like Someone said, If you throw away the paddle and just sit on the raft expecting the
                                waves of changes happening around you to take you somewhere, You will not only not know
                                where you are going but you will end up getting somewhere where you did not want to go
                                in life. You might say I am going somewhere just in a slow phase.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Well, To be honest with you what you do not know far outweighs what you know and the
                                same goes for every single one of us living on planet earth. And I had been the source
                                of motivation to find out what we do not know, It is the fear of the unknown and the
                                curiosity within us that fails to contain us in the known horizons.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                So keep exploring something new, Don't get surprised when something new has been
                                invented reducing your work requirements by half. The same happened in the automation of
                                testing within the software industry reducing the requirement for manual testing inside
                                it.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Who knows man, If we keep innovating enough we might just make ourselves obsolete and
                                honestly I am looking forward to it. It is a natural human progress man. I do not want
                                things to stay as messed up as it is right now. I want things to change. And it is the
                                change that makes other people wealthy, Brings people out of the poverty line, and
                                reforests the Sahara dessert. Take this example, We could instead focus on automatic
                                re-greenification of all the desserts in the world and probably find some pretty
                                innovative technologies that automatically ensure a healthy forest regrowth and
                                sustenance. How about that man, removing manpower requirements that are more expensive
                                and faulty.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                If we move too slowly and are a little bit relaxed in life. We might not reach there. We
                                will be 10 billion strong in just 80 years. I think the population is not the problem.
                                it is our ignorance.
