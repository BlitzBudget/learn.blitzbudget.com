                            <p>The short answer to that question is yes. It is not just a requirement but life demands
                                that
                                from you despite your circumstances.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I could be less fortunate than maybe half of the entire population on earth. It is only
                                when
                                we compare ourselves with someone else or something else.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The necessity to compare ourselves with others is inherent as Jordan Peterson put it.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The hierarchy is so ancient that it even ingrained the neurology of lobsters with whom
                                we
                                evoke away from millions of years ago!!
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The hierarchy of systems is so ancient that it is not inherent to the capitalistic
                                economy
                                or even the democracy it is evident in life itself.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                So no matter how we put ourselves and organize ourselves a hierarchy of competence in
                                that
                                hierarchy is going to emerge and as a result, someone is going to do much better than we
                                did
                                in that area of competence.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Even if we are the best of the best in that area and uncontested for a decade that does
                                not
                                guarantee that you are going to stay for a decade more as the best among the best. It is
                                often the arrogance to say that I am going to be the best for the next that is necessary
                                to
                                stay competitive.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                But not if you are ungrateful about your gifts. Everything that we pay less attention to
                                just fades away from life. It slowly moves far away. People and even money love
                                attention as
                                Grant Cardone put it!!
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Anything that we pay less attention to would inevitably think that we are not grateful
                                for
                                their presence and remove themselves from ourselves.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                That connects well with the dopamine we talked about earlier. It is the gratefulness
                                aspect
                                of it which triggers the dopamine in our body man.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It’s just awesome how the whole body works right? How we feel about something makes the
                                brain release certain hormones in this case dopamine and it is responsible for making us
                                feel accomplished and satisfied with what we have so we can move on and aim higher than
                                we
                                previously could.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Imagine the other way around, if we are ungrateful to what we have is just ignoring what
                                we
                                already have but let’s take it one step further what if we take what we have just for
                                granted and imagine that what we have is just going to stay with us so I can just ignore
                                it
                                and focus on what is important right now.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Ha! If only! If only life worked that way, The billionaires could have become
                                billionaires
                                just alone right? You could focus on doing one thing faster than move on and build the
                                next
                                thing and move on and hope that everything stays together exactly as you had put
                                together
                                even without your attention. Life would have just been so easy.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The same just goes with everything. Everything just degrades without attention. Enough
                                attention and maintenance would have to be provided simply to keep it functional and
                                keep it
                                working. Sometimes we might have to throw it all away to buy new machinery altogether.
                                The
                                same goes with life man. We all degrade to nothingness physically, emotionally and
                                spiritually after a certain age.
                                <br>

                                The most energetic state is the state in which we are the most productive and beneficial
                                to
                                us, everyone around us and as an extension the whole world. Tony Robbins would call it
                                Synergy!
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It’s all the same thing however you call it. It only stems from being grateful for what
                                you
                                have in your life thereby paying enough attention to it which ensures that what you have
                                at
                                least stays with you as efficiently as it possibly can.

                                <br>
                                It could be people, things, power or money among other things. What does gratefulness
                                ensure
                                in the end? It ensures that you pay enough attention to it.

                                God, I love attention, we all love attention, and the media loves your attention. It is
                                the
                                single biggest sellable commodity that anyone has in their entire lives and the
                                marketing
                                company spends billions and trillions simply to get your attention.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                When I hear Spotify, I hear Uber and McDonald’s Advertising every X minutes. Not because
                                I
                                want to but because I am simply using the Free version of Spotify and it takes money to
                                Run
                                Spotify so they run ads. I am forced to listen even if I don’t want to.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                But you know what my subconscious would probably think of Uber when I think of taking a
                                cab
                                at least more in comparison with other companies because I am hearing it more often than
                                others like Cabify or Free Now.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                That’s aggressive marketing simply to get 6 to 7 seconds of my attention man. And it
                                works
                                even if I don’t want to.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Because what you pay attention to is what you are grateful about and what you are
                                grateful
                                about has the most likelihood of sticking around with you longer. And what sticks around
                                you
                                longer is who you are most likely to become.
