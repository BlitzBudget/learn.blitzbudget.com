                            <p>
                                I mean when someone is staring at you. Are they being mean to
                                you and making you feel uncomfortable?
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                When someone like you and gives you a seductive flare and you start to like it do you
                                reduce that person to a charming person? Even though it is a positive reduction of their
                                personality it is still a reduction, right?
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Let’s look at some neutral reduction. When you see someone and think oh they are
                                Chinese, they are Americans, they are Indians. We are often putting people in a box. It
                                is a necessary phenomenon to understand their character and predict how they would
                                behave. And the set of behaviours to expect.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                But there are negative reductions as well. Often seen too much in the US, the most
                                famous ones are the #BlackLivesMatter moment. When a society sees someone as their
                                colour and immediately behaves differently to them simply because of their colour.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                God! Which human being puts their knee on a person for 8 minutes for having a
                                counterfeit 20-dollar note! Seriously dude! You’ve got some issues. And kills the person
                                as a result. Truth be told if not for the moment that cop would have been a free man.
                                Who knows where he is right now anyway!
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It just makes me scared of going to America! I am starting to put México and America in
                                the same risk basket. Guys don’t hate me for expressing my fears!
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I know I am an ignorant person who knows nothing about beautiful free America. I am just
                                expressing my ignorant fears. Now don’t reduce me to someone who hates America and stop
                                reading this book.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                That’s what you are going to do once you reduce me to some negative person. You are
                                immediately going to think. I’ve got this person figured out and never going to open
                                this book again!
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                That is what reduction does to people. That’s what reduction does!! It closes our minds
                                to possibilities. Is it possible for me to have one more thing valuable in this blog or
                                book?? That you can learn or learn not to do?
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I think that the chances are high!! I’ve got a convincing argument I hope. So! Having
                                said that! Most of the successful people I follow are Americans by the way. The recent
                                one is Grant Cardone! That guy has got something in him that is so engaging man!
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Take whatever resonates with you and leave the rest right? That’s what I tried to do
                                with him. He said once that everyone feels lost at some point in their lives. I felt so
                                resonated with him. I had to lose myself every time I migrate to a different country.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It feels like you lose all of your circle and had to start over again and now you are in
                                a foreign country where they speak different languages than what you knew so you
                                couldn’t connect with the people over here.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I still remember coming here and feeling that everyone look the same and couldn’t even
                                tell the difference between one person or the other let alone tell the age difference by
                                looking at their faces.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It felt super weird! Everyone looked the same. It took a very long time for my brain to
                                start seeing the difference in people at least the wrinkles on their faces.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Then slowly started seeing the misery in people's faces and that is often the best
                                giveaway for the poor people and the middle-class ones. And then slowly the Latinos and
                                the Spanish.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                And then Slowly everybody other than the Latinos and Spanish is in the other European
                                basket right now.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I have to refine myself even further. I am only trying to understand people better and
                                know where they are coming from.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I am trying to be very careful with how I am defining them. It also helps me restrict
                                certain types of behaviour that they would find offensive. It helps in a lot of ways.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                My point is. We reduce categorising people all the time. It is a part of the process
                                that we do subconsciously knowingly or unknowingly. It is either a learnt from others or
                                just through experience.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                These types of categorization often go wrong. I have seen the worst types of
                                categorization. The Caste system which is most prevalent in India was a class system
                                brought about by the kings long ago and it slowly became a caste system thereby giving
                                room for discrimination and voluntary reduction of people to that caste.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                That caste defined them as a human and what they are worth and what jobs they could get
                                and how high they could get in their lives. Including how much respect they could get
                                from society and until most recently how much education they could get. They were used
                                as a system to ensure systemic injustices to people until the emergency of democracy
                                which demanded judicially that all people are equal in law.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Which is probably the single best thing that the western nations have provided the East.
                                The single best thing! Honestly! You guys just don’t realize how much good this has been
                                to hundreds of millions of people who are now at least legally required to be treated
                                equally.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                A lot of people still do not know that. Now that’s a different story. It takes a long
                                time for an idea to seep into society. We are a relatively you d democracy in India it
                                has just been 75 years. Give it more time man!

                                <br>
                                Until recently before the British, we were treated as different nations and only unified
                                under the British imperial empire under the same wing Calle India! Which included
                                Pakistan and Bengal by the way.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The systemic wars that are going on between Pakistan and India and the involuntary
                                hatred that automatically goes with saying the word Kashmir. A major point of conflict
                                between India, Pakistan and even China.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It’s a true nightmare in epic proportions we have studied with people from all nations
                                and when we meet on foreign soil, we are united for some reason. Even the Pakistanis.
                                They are often the most friendly people I’ve personally encountered man.
                                <br>

                                It took me a long time to see people as human beings. I’ve always been ignoring people
                                based on the possibility of being a friend or not.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                If you can befriend me, I shall provide my attention and my time if not, if I don’t
                                understand you then I usually ignored you!
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It was so hard to understand people with my ignorant personality and intellect and how I
                                coped it is by ignoring them and as a result man. I suffered. A lot by not having enough
                                friends and losing the possibility of having a good human being as a possible friend.

                                It is ok to reduce someone at a particular time to their sub-personality and treat them
                                as such as long as the sub-personality is active. When it is turned off! Treat them as
                                they want to be treated. I fail more often than every single one of you. I guarantee
                                you. I Gail more than you in this. But I try to do it!!!
