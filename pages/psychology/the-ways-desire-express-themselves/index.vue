                            <p>
                                that desire takes and how they manifest
                                themselves differently in different sorts of people.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Desiré is a tricky feeling. We know where we are currently and what our peers are doing
                                currently and where they are at. That is how our inner hierarchy meter lets us know how
                                we should feel about ourselves. We all know that it exists but couldn’t put it in words.
                                Jordan Peterson helps me with this in the form of his lectures on YouTube.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It also means that we are consistently monitoring our status without us knowing that we
                                are doing it. Which could tell us how we should feel about ourselves (miserable,
                                content, satisfied) amongst other plethora of emotions that we are capable of feeling.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Then occasionally we meet people given the circumstances who are where we dreamed of
                                being one day. And, that can make us feel in many different ways.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I have always admired them and never ever imagined that you could see those who have
                                achieved more than you in a different light.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It is after meeting the pure communists that I came to know that they despise them for
                                their success.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It is after meeting insecure people that I found out that they can feel jealous of what
                                others possess.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Sometimes people can be jealous and despise them. If enough people feel that way, they
                                can gather the strength to take it away from the people that they despise and distribute
                                it amongst themselves. Has happened many times over in the past and is bound to happen
                                in the present and is inevitable in the future.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Then there are people with whom ego could be hurt because they met someone so out of
                                their league and they were the ones who wanted to be at the top but now find themselves
                                second in the hierarchy. This is why Ego is a negative emotion and jealousy is probably
                                less negative compared to Ego.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                An egoistic person is then bound to get back to the top. If they are aligned properly in
                                the world. They would just strive to reach the top by working hard. I am a conscientious
                                person and that’s how I see the world to be.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I think that’s a fair judgement provided that we get lucky now and then. We are bound to
                                get lucky if we keep learning and are extremely grateful for our circumstances. I
                                understand it is not for everyone.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                As such we meet people who want to get back to the top of the hierarchy by pulling
                                others down. Undermining the truly worthy and convincing themselves that the one at the
                                top is truly unworthy and the only worthy ones are they and the world construed in any
                                other way is unjust as they know they are the ones who deserve that.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                That is also Desire. Desire can also take the form of admiration. And the admiration is
                                an act of imitation to become what the person you admire is doing. Children do it all
                                the time. They imitate. You cannot imitate what you do not admire. You cannot observe
                                what you do not admire long enough to imitate.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It was because I admired successful people I thought of meticulously going through all
                                the free videos of those people and understanding them, moulding my perceptions to
                                become someone more than what I was before. As a result, become a better person.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                And as a result of such an endeavor I can truly say that looking back just 10 years ago.
                                I have come a long way from where I was. That is the success that I wanted to achieve. I
                                am where I had hoped to be. Even though I wanted to buy a house at 28 but only managed
                                to buy it at 30.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                As long as we keep striving towards the goal that we defined after understanding where
                                we are and trying to understand where to go and find people who have already done it and
                                then desiring to be there one day we are bound to reach the place. Even if we are
                                halfway through it. As long as we don’t die let’s keep moving forward towards it and try
                                to reorient ourselves to achieve what we had hoped to.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Be careful if you seem to go farther and farther away from your goal the more you try
                                then you are not aligned with the truth. Try and learn why that is not happening. 9
                                times out of 10 it is some deep misperception that you might have which needs rebirth
                                like a phoenix and out of the ashes you can then start striving towards the goal.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Keep trying until you reach the goal. You will one day. Train your subconscious mind to
                                be disciplined enough to help you be motivated to keep learning every single day. That
                                can only happen with micro successes.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Define success not in large chunks but in minuscule chunks that you can do in one day
                                and try to do it. If you couldn’t do it then half your expectations and try again the
                                next. Slowly build your muscle up. As long as you do it every day you can reach there
                                one day.
