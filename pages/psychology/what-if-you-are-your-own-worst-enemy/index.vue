                            <p>
                                enemy. We are complicated enough that we do not
                                understand what we want, let alone strive to achieve it. We have to put ourselves
                                together before even trying to have an audacious dream. Most of the time when we try to
                                achieve a goal we will find out that we are our own worst enemy and a Putin also lives
                                inside us.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                At those times is almost always beneficial to ask in every situation what is it that I
                                did which has brought me to this situation. Even when you are the victim. People call
                                that victim-blaming. Sometimes. there is truly nothing that could have been done. You
                                were there at the wrong time and at the wrong place. Let us call that Tragedy but, 99%
                                of the time we can always do something about it. In fact, what is the use of worrying
                                about the things that we cannot even control? When we haven't even figured out how to
                                put ourselves together in such a way that we do not stand in between what we want and
                                where we are right now.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                An example would be procrastination. Or self-defeating thoughts, Or blaming genes on
                                something that you have the absolute power to control. Do you know that genes change all
                                the time? So there is absolutely no use blaming others under those circumstances or even
                                blaming life, When you have something to do about it, it is always just more practical
                                to simply do whatever it is in your power to and see the results that you have obtained.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Trust me that the results almost do not lie. Then all you have to do is what is it that
                                you should be doing to achieve what you want to achieve and if you do not work on it and
                                are binge-watching or doing whatever is it that you are doing other than working on your
                                dream then just give up on your dream and at least stop feeling miserable about
                                binge-watching. Just do that properly and become obese by having junk food if that's all
                                you want to do. Just don't be surprised when you get Cancer or Knee joint pain and ask
                                god why has he brought such unbearable pain and suffering to you when all that is that
                                you ever did was binge-watch Game Of Thrones all summer.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Like I always said what we do not know far outweighs what we know, forgetting the
                                butterfly effect. And most of the time we are constrained by what we are constrained.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                What if the goal is to obtain a job abroad. And how are you going to achieve it? It was
                                my goal initially, You know what I did. I had severe money constraints so, My dad had to
                                borrow money from relatives to get to do my masters in the UK and at that time there was
                                no PSW visa (Post Study Work Visa), So we just decided that I would study and come back
                                to work here in India.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Having made a plan I went to the UK started studying and even managed to finish my
                                course despite the circumstances. I happened to meet my wife there in the UK and fell in
                                love with her. And she asked me to find a job there. Which was practically impossible
                                for a graduate to get. I had to apply to do another master's degree in a college where
                                the tuition fees were very low only to get a visa. And used that time to just apply for
                                jobs like crazy. So finally despite the circumstances and constraints I get a job and
                                work there for a few months before getting fired for now knowing how to program. I was a
                                graduate someone had to teach me and they had no one to teach me. They said we don't
                                need some graduate who doesn't know what to do, we need someone who already knows how to
                                program.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                In the meantime, there was also a possibility to just do all the wrong things and just
                                continue to stay there. if our goal was just to stay in the UK. It is wrong because our
                                future would have been spoiled if we did that. Like there were different loopholes in
                                the law which let us show on paper that we were working for a company while we would
                                probably be doing something else.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Some people from my wife's province did exactly that. I told her after getting fired
                                that, the UK doesn't want us here. Let's go back. So I went back. Best decision ever.
                                Your soul knows when you are wrong, you can feel it in your gut.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I always imagine the gut feeling as something that you know and forgot but your
                                subconscious still remembers and lets you know that you are doing something wrong. I
                                used to feel that all the time. After integrating my emotions back into myself after a
                                decade. I do not know if I would get that again. What do I mean by that? I used to think
                                that what you feel should be hidden and should not be openly expressed. You should be
                                professional at work and not be too casual and let your emotions dictate your actions
                                nor get too close with others. In short, I was not sure that my emotions helped me
                                propagate towards my goal, I thought that the emotions stood in the way and prevented me
                                from achieving what I wanted to achieve so I had to shut them down and tyrannize myself.
                                As a consequence I had to suffer for a lot of time because I wouldn't express it in my
                                face, People found it harder to connect with me.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                After COVID hit, I had nothing to do but become a better self. And it took me a long
                                time, finally, I was able to integrate my emotions back and let them guide me to
                                formulating a better future together instead of me forcibly suppressing them. I feel
                                better and I am a much happier person. I feel like I can connect with people much
                                better. I am actually trying to be funny with others. Not feeling shy about being
                                embarrassed and vulnerable. I feel complete after a long time. I do not know if you can
                                call this, being my own worst enemy. I think I was reduced to something less efficient.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Sometimes it is just that, We reduce ourselves to something less and try harder and
                                harder only to find that the world around us resists. It just resists to provide us when
                                there is so much to go around. We are left dumbstruck not knowing why is it that it
                                happens to us. Well, it is almost always better to assume that it is us that has to
                                change and some part of us has to become a better self in order for the world to treat
                                us a little better.
