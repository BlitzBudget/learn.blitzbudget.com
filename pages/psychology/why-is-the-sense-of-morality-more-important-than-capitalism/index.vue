              <h3 class="title">Morality navigates us through life...</h3>
              <p>
                when there are infinite directions one could potentially take.
                Morality vastly restricts the number of pathways one could take.
                <br />
                <br />
                It could be something that the “self” wants but it could be
                wrong. It is wrong because it does not work out well if you play
                it out in the future for any number of years. All the
                circumstances of every individual might be different but the
                choices ones take concert the potential of the present to the
                Karma of the future.
                <br />
                <br />
                If you are 30 and miserable then it is all your doing. The
                choices that you might have taken when navigating the world
                might have been wrong and this is where it has got you!
                <br />
                <br />
                Don’t you worry! It is never too late to change yourself. For
                Being is always JUST. It delivers on to you what is rightfully
                yours and if you think if you have escaped it then it might be
                your children’s burden to carry them forward. That does not
                absolve you from anything, that just means that karma takes the
                form through your child or society and will haunt you when you
                are old or will forever taint your image after you are dead.
                <br />
                <br />
                Let us say who cares about death and what happens after one
                dies, all that matters is now and what happens next. But, what
                happens next is up to you and the choices that you make will
                affect you and others surrounding you. I am sure that no one in
                their right mind would want something bad for their loved ones
                or their children.

              <h3 class="title">What happens to a society without morality?</h3>
              <p>
                Let’s look at India for example. It’s a typical example in my
                experience. After the year 2000, there was the globalization of
                India and thus all the companies that could never have opened a
                branch in India can! <br />
                This meant that the ideologies of the US seeped into Indian
                cities destroying the concepts of religion in certain members of
                the population but that also meant that people are no longer
                constrained by anything. It is a true sense of freedom in some
                sense which is why it is enticing. A weak soul is always
                attracted to the fallacies of the fantasies without caring about
                the future consequences that wait for them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thus moving ever so slowly away from religion and everything
                good about it. Including morality. All of which are now
                destroyed. Now, we can do anything legal, in other words, the
                law is the only thing preventing someone from doing horrible
                things to each other to earn more money.
              </p>
              <p>
                I do not remember the name of the Netflix documentary but there
                was a short-term lending company in the US that lent money to
                typically poor people for a fixed fee, at least that’s what the
                people who took the short-term loan thought. Once they got the
                money from the company they found out that they were paying much
                more than they initially thought they have to pay. Upon
                contacting the firm they found out that everything was written
                in small text like terms and conditions so they were legally
                covered.
              </p>
              <p>
                Imagine this happening to someone who got a 300$ Loan. They took
                the loan because they did not have that money in the first place
                now they have paid 500$ in total to the firm to repay the
                short-term loan in under 3 months and only then are they able to
                fully repay the short-term loans. These are single mothers with
                2 or more kids, truck drivers, divorcees who could not get
                through to the end of the month with what they earn.
              </p>
              <p>
                The company was closed down and the top management was put in
                jail for a long term even though they were legally covered. In
                the end, the CEO said “we did not do anything illegal,
                everything that we did was legal, this is unfair”.
              </p>
              <p>
                What did they do wrong? What is missing? We all know immediately
                that even though they did everything legally there is something
                fundamentally wrong. I did not understand that documentary then
                I was left confused because I was a pure capitalist then but I
                know now why the judge chose to sentence the top management and
                close down the company.
              </p>
              <p>The company completely lacked a sense of morality!!</p>
              <p>
                Morality is the right way of living that will only bring you
                good in the future. This is only if you do not fool yourself
                that something bad is a sense of morality or take an ideology
                and live by it! In the end, all ideologies are fundamentally
                flawed since one ideology can never encompass the whole of
                humanity and our evolutionary sense of right and wrong.
              </p>
              <p>
                What is right is how you navigate the world that is truly
                beneficial for you and your loved ones now and in the future. An
                impulse is sometimes right but most times wrong, you eat a large
                plate of Biriyani and once the satisfaction subsides, all that
                we are left with is the guilt if our goal is to keep ourselves
                in shape and reduce our weight. We have all been there!!
              </p>
              <p>
                Do what you know to be right and try to become a better person
                by letting morality guide you to the future.
