                                and wonder how fruitfully we all were designed. So delicate that a virus can kill millions
                                of us, yet intelligent enough that
                                if we maintain a healthy body and soul, we can reach the stars.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Such is the potential of human existence. One man dreaming to set up a base on Mars
                                builds a reusable rocket, which has never been done ever before. No one knows if he can
                                pull it off, but everyone agrees that if there is someone who can do it, it very well has to
                                be Elon Musk, who can't give a speech without stammering.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                To achieve the impossible, one has to believe in the impossible and then shed all the
                                shackles holding him from reaching there. Along the way, we meet people whom we can
                                never ignore, but who will try to force their influence upon us. It becomes increasingly
                                harder as we age and gather more experiences in life.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                But it becomes all the more possible when we are more vulnerable and helpless. This is why
                                most of
                                the time we wish to stay in the known territory, all cosy and comfortable, confronting
                                the known rather than the unknown. For something far worse than death awaits. Those who
                                fear death, pain, and suffering, which is deliberately induced out of selfishness, can do us
                                in and ensure that we never ever get the fortification to explore the unknown again.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Which makes it all the more necessary to become stronger and independent, and gather
                                well-wishers along the way who are there by your side when things go rough, through
                                thick and thin. Even with all this, it might be barely possible to reach the stars. Or
                                so I believed.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Recently, I have been blatantly made aware of the fact that if I do not focus on my goal
                                10 - 16 hours a day, then the possibility of reaching the pinnacle of success is near
                                zero. Another man, who is willing to work for 16 hours to achieve it, will get it, not
                                you.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Seems scary though, not reaching the goal, but at what expense? If it is at the expense
                                of your friends, family, loved ones, your hobby, and your inner peace, would it still be
                                luring enough to attain?
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                That kind of answers the question of why money does not buy happiness, though Blair
                                Waldorf disagrees with me. I can reasonably say that money without inner peace is just
                                a wasted life.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                As Jordan Peterson says, about the big 5 personality types, which define among others if
                                speaking to people makes us happy or fixing things makes us happy. We have to be attuned
                                to our inner soul, which has more than necessary information on what will make us
                                fulfilled and which has the potential to make us miserable.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                One among us is the two-faced enemy, an enemy who poses as your close friend and a
                                well-wisher, but always has their own goals on their mind, which may not be aligned with
                                your
                                goals.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                And worst of all, if they want something from you, they make you feel miserable for not
                                giving
                                it to them, in the subtlest of ways. They might say they love you, but they love
                                themselves and just want your attention and some of the things you have.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Once you give it to them, they might need more of it, without regard to your well-being.
                                However, not so much so that it kills you, just enough so that you do not die, and you do
                                not
                                notice that you are dying but feel that something is wrong, just not knowing exactly what
                                that is.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The master manipulators who pose as victims when necessary, when they want something,
                                they become the Virgin Mary, who is the epitome of sacrifice, having lost her son, so that
                                the world may not suffer, but behind the scenes, they will ensure that you do not get
                                what you want if that is not aligned with your goals.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                They may even gather people around them who may benefit from them every now and then. It is
                                not that they want something from you all the time, but they might need it someday, and they
                                want to ensure
                                that you stick around until that day comes.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Such people can be found if you ask them for something in return, and they will shy away
                                from it, or the intelligent ones will give you only 1/10th of what you gave them, leaving
                                you
                                confused.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Relationships are definitely not a measurement battle. There is no conscious effort
                                involved in a relationship that measures everything, but leaving that to your emotions.
                                What is it that you feel when you are around them? Do you feel positive emotions or
                                negative emotions?
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The worst of those will leave you feeling miserable for who you are. Just be grateful enough
                                that that person is giving you their time and attention so that you may feel good. Never
                                ever be in that position if the alternative is being homeless. Only then,
                                build another alternative and jump.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Another easy indicator of such people is that they call you and just suck all the
                                information out of you. They use "information as power" in the CCP way. Take all the
                                information in and never leave any information out.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                That leaves you feeling powerful, as the enemy does not know your vulnerability.
