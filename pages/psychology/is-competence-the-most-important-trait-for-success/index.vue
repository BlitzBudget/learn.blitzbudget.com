                            <p> to do something successfully and efficiently.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                By far the most necessary default skill set required to be able to shine at anything in
                                life
                                but does that by default mean that you are competing with everyone else who is working
                                with
                                you for example?
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Should you put compete with them? What if it is your boss? Should you put compete with
                                your
                                boss? What if you have more skills than your boss and are competing with them in their
                                own
                                game?
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I am pretty sure that your boss would be extremely unhappy about it and would try to
                                stop
                                you from outcompeting him at any cost. Because we are playing a Zero-sum game. To be the
                                most competent in our game we are trying to put compete with someone else in their own
                                game.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I did that in my new job and all that happened is that I pissed off a few of my
                                colleagues
                                and I am sure that trust is just broken man. It’s never gonna come back. They are not
                                your
                                life partners they are probably not going to forgive you. At least not until you loosen
                                up
                                and give up playing a zero-sum game.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                A game that is zero-sum and is required to put compete with others with sheer competence
                                is
                                not replicable in a work environment.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                But it is ok if you do it in a business or a soccer game or anywhere else in the world.
                                You
                                can even try to compete with someone in a friendly competition but play too hard and be
                                too
                                serious about it.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                So it all depends on the context in which you use your competence. If it is a person who
                                is
                                extremely competent but struggling to move up the ladder may be because you have pissed
                                off
                                too many people and are truly unpopular among your colleagues.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                That’s something that you can work with. That you can change. That is well within your
                                power
                                and capability.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Seeing an interview of Vanessa Van Edwards when she was promoting her book “Cues” in
                                Lewis
                                showed show made me realize that I was missing something at work and that missing piece
                                was
                                being charming.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                And being charming was also one of the most important and equally essential traits and
                                as
                                important as competence.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It makes so much sense man. Competence alone is just too much for people to handle at
                                times.
                                We need to balance that out with charm. It makes so much sense! That balancing behaviour
                                is
                                so essential to ensure that people like you and only those people that like you would
                                even
                                acknowledge that you know something.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                And only they acknowledge that you know something will they have the possibility to
                                acknowledge that you are better at something may be more than they however hard it could
                                be
                                for them to digest that information.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It hurts people's egos. I am sure. I remember when I first entered Spain from India. In
                                India, I was so confident about myself and I knew that I was above average then I come
                                to
                                Spain and subconsciously I accept that it is a developed country and India is a
                                developing
                                country and as a result somehow I am much less than them.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It affected my confidence so much. So much!! It took almost 6 years for me to recover
                                from
                                that. It takes its toll on you man. It is only then that I understood what it was like
                                to
                                feel insecure and have low self-esteem.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It was foreign to me up until then and even though I did not use my words I used my
                                action
                                and carefree ness to denigrate others in India who were not so fortunate as I was and
                                honestly I shouldn’t have done that.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                But I don’t think I could have done anything about it in the work environment. It was
                                negotiable for me to do it simply to keep myself together.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Sometimes we do project our insecurities and to cover it up we try to be better at
                                something
                                and sometimes all we want is acceptance of our capabilities. It is that acceptance that
                                we
                                are craving.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                But acceptance comes from them loving us. Acceptance can't come about if they reject
                                your
                                attitude. Everything is thrown out of the window! At that moment!
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                That realization is what makes me believe beyond a doubt that when we are living in
                                society
                                it is extremely important to be a better human beings first. Then and only then does
                                competence have any importance in the industry.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Without being a good moral human being out competing and denigrating those whom all
                                honesty
                                are doing their best to just make a living is just being a D***.
