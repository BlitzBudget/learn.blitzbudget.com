                            <h3 class="title">I’ve personally struggled with this a lot...</h3>
                            <p>
                                After consuming tonnes of personal
                                self-improvement content. I finally came to the conclusion that I have been passionate
                                about what I do and just keep pushing.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I did not know what passion was nor did I clearly know how to keep pushing. Naively I
                                tried to be oblivious to the emotional part and how I felt and just started writing
                                blogs and creating a financial app to help organize personal finances.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I think my first web application took me around 1 and half years to complete. While at
                                it, I had always felt this deep emptiness. I do not know how else to describe it. When
                                you keep pushing and pushing there was this empty feeling in the heart but you had
                                learnt that those who quit when times get tough never reach anywhere in life.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                So even when my emotion was telling me to stop, I didn’t, I thought emotion was
                                something to be controlled and checked because at least at that time it was working
                                directly against me. Or so I thought.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Little did I know that feeling empty and exhausted made me a colder person to the entire
                                world. I took that feeling and was so hellbent on achieving my goals no matter what.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                At the expense of social circles, at the expense of a lot of other possible
                                opportunities. It made me realize that for someone to push towards something that much.
                                One has to be crystal clear about where one wants to go and just how much one wants to
                                achieve their goals.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I was miserable when I did that!! I just pushed it with my willpower. There was a
                                well-balanced way out of it. I did not understand that. When I say pushed my way, you
                                might think of the world resisting me but no! It was me pushing myself despite the huge
                                resistance my body and soul put through.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I remember at last before finishing it I just gave up and chose not to complete it. I
                                did not touch that app for the next 2 years nor did I try to finish it, I tried to
                                develop the things around the application. But stopped working on the application
                                itself.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The task seemed to have pushed me to an absolute breaking point. I didn’t understand why
                                I was so weak and couldn’t push myself to complete something. So, I set on a journey to
                                understand myself more which apparently lead me to Jordan Peterson's content which I
                                religiously consumed for the next 5 -6 months everything there is to consume regarding
                                his content. God! so much to consume. I just saw his initial videos explaining the
                                disadvantages of taking political moments like feminism to their extreme and the
                                consequences of those actions.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I always assumed that I had figured out how to do it but didn't realize for one bit that
                                reading books would not directly translate to becoming wise.
                                It just gave you some information to sort and organize. But the ability to attend! can
                                be improved by broadening our knowledge of things that we are currently oblivious to but
                                should not be. And truly understanding the consequences of being oblivious to those
                                things. And one such thing for me was that my emotion was directly working against me.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                When people said that your soul, body and mind should be singularly focused on one thing
                                long enough to achieve it. I took that for granted. Yes, I have the skills to make
                                things happen and I will. Apparently, I did not at least back then. There were different
                                impulses and spontaneous instincts that I had to work on first. And had to truly
                                understand that the most valuable thing there is in this world to make some progress is
                                the ability to align my mind, body and soul towards a task and manage to complete it.
                                But little did I know that that energy is finite and should not be taken as an infinite
                                source of energy that you can bend to your own.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                There are tips and tricks to fool your soul to align when it is not working in the way
                                that it should. But they only help you become something if you truly believe that you
                                can be whoever you want to be, whenever you want to be and however you want to be by
                                simply acting towards that goal at the present.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                You have all right to have unrealistic expectations only if you are willing to outwork,
                                outsmart and out talent everyone else in your current field. I have been trying to
                                reduce my weight and keep it in control. So having worked on that for a while, I see a
                                pattern in my behaviour. When it reaches a point where I am happy with my weight, I
                                subconsciously convince myself that I deserve something and I eat and gain some weight
                                which I work to reduce afterwards. This has been quick evident when I synched my
                                weighing scale to the app. the pattern repeated every time I reach the weight I want to.
                                I noticed that it is a limiting mentality that I have. In the sense that I am
                                subconsciously ok with not having a muscular body. I have to train myself now that it is
                                not acceptable to not be fit anymore and then focus on pushing my weight further down.
                                While this is easier said than done. I have been training to do just that for a while
                                now and I feel confident enough to say that it works.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                But be careful with that thought right? sometimes I say it is not ok to become poor you
                                will become a millionaire and you are going to. you will be. Your brain immediately says
                                "No Way!!". You are taken aback by that thought and you refuse to accept no for an
                                answer. That part is what I am calling subconscious which tells you to "piss off" when
                                you are trying to achieve something. How do you handle this situation? We have all been
                                there. We have tips and tricks. It is by no means exhaustive but at least some of the
                                ways that I have been trying to work on it. I will also put the ones that didn't work so
                                you could learn from that as well.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                In the recent Tom Bilyeu podcasts, I noticed that he answered a very important question
                                that I could not get from Jordan Peterson. He said, Don't align your identity towards a
                                goal but align your identity towards being a learner and adapter. So you can always
                                adapt and learn to move towards the goal, it also has been an added advantage of not
                                being disappointed after reaching the goal. It also kind of prevents me from giving too
                                much importance towards the goal and belittling others for having a smaller goal than
                                mine. That thought takes you to a darker place. You can judge me for that, How could I?
                                Can you honestly say that you haven't judged anyone before?
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                According to Jordan Peterson's Lobster theory, we are neurologically conditioned to
                                build a hierarchy and even lobsters have a hierarchy. How do you build a hierarchy if
                                society is incapable of judging? Judging is just a bad term for measuring. We are
                                measuring other people. That is all there is to it, I suppose. So do not fear measuring
                                while always being critical of judging others. That has to be differentiated in my
                                opinion because judging is often judging critically of others while measuring is the act
                                of measuring one's goals and seeing if they are aligned towards the light or darkness
                                and what is the primary source of the energy that they use to move towards that goal.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                You could use anger, shame, revenge, and other negative emotions to move away from where
                                you are, and who you are with and move towards a future improved self where in you have
                                what you want in life. But if you are tying that achievement with happiness and the
                                process of attaining that with misery you will not be disappointed most times, after you
                                have achieved it. It also comes with a bigger question right? what now? what are you
                                going to do after you have achieved the goal that you very badly wanted to achieve for
                                the past ten years, you sacrificed everything to ensure that you would achieve that
                                goal. Now that you have achieved it and you look around, The things that you initially
                                had before you were successful, you no longer have it. Because you took them for granted
                                or shamed them for not having an equally big goal as yours or were ashamed of showing
                                your face to them because you were not successful in your own estimation.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The human soul is a social animal and truly requires you to have someone to love and be
                                loved around us. But taking that love, be it from parents, loved ones or even your
                                friends. Taking them for granted will only take you to a place without those people
                                around. Most of the time when we move blindly towards something we never take into
                                account our ignorance. Our Ignorance, taking things for granted and thinking it does not
                                require any more watering and attention will definitely lead to their inevitable
                                departure from you.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I have always found this exercise to be useful. Ask yourself where you want to go and do
                                give 100% of your singular-minded, non-self-restricted approach towards achieving that
                                goal. But don't attach that to your identity. And never attach your successes to your
                                identity. Once you do! You have essentially failed. Why? What happens when that success
                                is taken away from you? Yes, you have it now. But change is the only constant and it
                                takes simultaneously gives and takes everything at times from you all at once and leaves
                                you on the streets with nothing but yourself to be around with.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                What then? Why is it that success matters? When you align yourself to the biggest dream
                                and aim towards it and try to achieve it (Jordan Peterson's words) you can at least
                                start moving towards them and that selfless act of wanting progress for
                                self-preservation of self and your immediate loved ones would be enough to feel
                                fulfilled about making progress in that endeavour. When we do not make progress we beat
                                ourselves up for being a stupid person incapable of making progress and when we make
                                some progress we feel happy and accomplished.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Having more simple means you could do more, and have a little more for sharing and feel
                                good about yourself for sharing. I have heard someone not liking the word motivation but
                                I still have to use a term for you wanting to achieve something and moving towards that
                                goal. That motivation is almost always the precursor for action.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                So how can you truly channel your emotions to be more productive? By not ignoring what
                                you currently have, especially your loved ones, By appreciating what you already have
                                and continuously nourishing what you already have. Remember our goal is to get more, not
                                lose everything in the process of moving towards that goal. If by making progress you
                                feel like you are leaving your loved ones in despair, It means you guys have to align,
                                Make the effort to be aligned again and then with the remainder of our time focus on our
                                goals. If you feel like you couldn't start, Have a different room where you only work
                                and be religious about it don't do anything else. Have a room or a place for a
                                nourishing relationship and always have an open mind and heart and be willing to learn,
                                often your loved ones will tell you months before you lose them that you are not giving
                                enough attention and love. Most of all love yourself, Love others and understand that
                                being motivated by light and moving towards a goal that truly is more meaningful will
                                ensure that you do not give up along the way.
