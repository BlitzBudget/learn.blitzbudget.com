              <h3 class="title">Sanji, A chef in Baratie is a peculiar character...</h3>
              <p>
                in the sense that he is introduced to Luffy as this
                Chef who will feed any enemy (Gin a member of Don Krieg's fleet of pirates and later Don Krieg himself)
                even though it might come back to bite him after on.
                <br />
                <br />
                The strength of the character of Luffy is shown when he fights Don Krieg and defeats him. This partially
                convinces Sanji but the chefs in Baraties are convinced that Sanji should be going along with Luffy to
                find the All Blue where all the fishes in the ocean are present.
                <br />
                <br />
                As such Sanji is introduced as a character who has a dream of becoming the best chef and finding this
                amazing place he could cook all the dishes that anybody wants as all the fishes unite in this ocean
                called All Blue. Even though no Body knows it exists, Sanji is convinced that it does. The people who
                dream big are noble in a sense. Luffy core pirates are packed with people who would want to be something
                more.
                <br />
                <br />


                It feels like they are going on a journey together but everybody has their dreams yet Luffy unites them
                together and never comes in between them and their dreams. It is because of the promise that they could
                achieve the dream that they are together. Coming back to Sanji, His noblest of characters seems to be
                gathered from the Baratie while he seems to have this other side that is revealed for the first time in
                Water Seven where Sanji takes off investigating Robin when Robin disappears with CP9.
                <br />
                <br />


                That is probably the first time Sanji shows this side of him which is not naive but investigative. A
                person who sees through the situation and intends to find the truth. Until then he is always seen as
                this person who is naive in a sense but can fight like crazy with a sense of morality and sense of
                purity about cooking, This purity towards cooking can be seen when he refuses to use his hands for a
                fight which is meant only for cooking.
                <br />
                <br />


                All this paints a picture of Sanji as a person who is strong and saves people from tough situations.
                From the list of the strongest person in the Luffy crew, I had always seen Sanji as the third strongest
                person in the crew after Luffy and Zoro. As they say, every strong person can be broken with enough
                force.
                <br />
                <br />


                This can be seen in Zou island where Sanji chooses to ditch his crew temporarily by promising Nami and
                Brook that he would come back. This apparent change in the Sanji's heart is through a series of
                blackmails by fire tank pirates where they blackmail Sanji that if he refuses to come to Whole Cake
                Island for his marriage they would kill everybody that he knows including those in Baratie and Luffy
                Pirates.
                <br />
                <br />


                He is thoroughly convinced that it is indeed a great possibility and goes with the Fire Tank Pirates to
                get Married to Pudding. What surprises the most is that Sanji almost with all his might hits Luffy
                intending to kill Luffy when Luffy comes to take back Sanji knowing that he is kidnapped. The decision
                of Sanji to harm Luffy even when Luffy refuses to hit Sanji shows that Luffy can see through people. It
                is evident when he says "you are one getting hurt more by hitting me!" true words man. Luffy truly shows
                that sometimes the best course of action is to do nothing and get betrayed and hit to death by your
                closes friend.
                <br />
                <br />


                I wonder how many of us would choose to do it when push comes to shove. No wonder, Sanji starts crying
                on the way to the wedding ceremony. His Brothers are brutal to him as well including his father Judge,
                who is always critical of Sanji and tells him that he is the weakest of all the siblings. And the most
                ironic of the situation is shown when Luffy pirates flee after rescuing Sanji when Judge lists Sanji's
                drawbacks.
                <br />
                <br />


                "What's so good about him? Straw Hat Luffy?"
                <br />
                <br />
                "This is Emperor Big Moms territory, once you enter the territory there is no going back. Why would you
                risk your life for him (Sanji)?"
                <br />
                <br />
                "Sanji is Germa's Failure"
                <br />
                <br />
                "He's easily moved like an idiot! (As in he has a heart is moved by signs of good intentions)"
                <br />
                <br />
                "His soft mind makes him put his life at risk for the weak"
                <br />
                <br />
                "He is a failure, That is all he is"
                <br />
                <br />

                To which Luffy replies.
                <br />
                <br />


                I'm Surprised. Why did Judge suddenly start listing all the good things about Sanji?
                <br />
                <br />

                The response from Luffy was so good that I started laughing. God! What is seen as a failure by a
                power-hungry immoral heartless person driven by the hunger for power and strength is seen as the
                greatest success by Luffy who sees all the characteristics listed by Judge as a list of good things
                about Sanji?
                <br />
                <br />


                Those who help the weak without expecting anything cannot be bad people. A person with a heart gets
                moved more often than others who refuse to let the heart have its say but that is not a sign of strength
                as most often confused by men. It is to let the heart express its truest emotions which would make you
                the most vulnerable and noble at the same time. A person with a heart is almost always trustworthy while
                a heartless person is a monster.
                <br />
                <br />


                A person driven by his dream, a selfless character who helps the week, is the polar opposite of Bad!
                Moreover, a person who gets happy by cooking delicious meals for others cannot ever be bad. But they can
                be forced to serve the bad like once in Whole Cake Island where Sanji forcibly hit Luffy to protect
                Luffy's crew from Germa 66, all the chefs in Baratie from Big Mom and Sanji's Hands which were cuffed by
                Germa 66 with explosives which would blast rendering his hands useless.
                <br />
                <br />


                When forced he broke and almost killed Luffy. It takes a person like Luffy to bring a person from
                self-deception (Sanji convincing himself that if he sacrifices his dream and marries pudding for the
                greater good everything would turn out to be good). Luffy to help Sanji from his self-deception chooses
                to rather starve to death until Sanji brings him food.
                <br />
                <br />


                God! Such a stroke of brilliance by Luffy. He bet that his friend Sanji would never abandon his friend
                and anyone hungry. But it was not just that which forced Sanji to go back to Luffy and feed him. His
                dream about a life with Pudding also had to be shattered. When Pudding reveals her dual personality
                where she tried to kill Poison Pink (Sanji's sister) and reveals the plot to kill all of the Germa 66 to
                take their scientific technology from them.
                <br />
                <br />


                All of which makes Sanji regret the decision and makes him run to Luffy and feed him. It also cannot be
                helped right? He saw the side of Pudding where she is the sweetest personalty ever and Sanji saw the
                truth behind the deception where he sees through the inner desire of Pudding. It is revealed when he
                saves Pudding even after she tries to kill Sanji during the wedding. That truly breaks Pudding. The best
                of Sanji's character is shown at that moment when he chooses to help pudding despite her trying to kill
                him. The noblest of characteristics. A true character of the greatest chef.
