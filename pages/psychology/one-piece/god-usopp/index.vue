              <h3 class="title">A liar and a coward...</h3>
              <p>
                His father Yasopp became a pirate and his mother died due to illness. it must have
                been really hard for Usopp to realize that the only two people that would care for him endlessly have
                disappeared from his life practically forever!
                <br />
                <br />
                It should leave a child devastated. Everyone must wonder if Yasopp loved Usopp enough to come back and
                raise him but We do not yet know if Yasopp was aware of his wife’s death and still chose not to come
                back what would that have made him? But anyway it seems that he doesn’t come back to take Usopp and
                Usopp is seen in the Syrup village always alone (without any guardians) and has no home to return to!
                <br />
                <br />
                He seems to always take shelter in the forests. Every morning he runs to the village screaming at the
                top of his lungs that the pirates have arrived alarming the villagers. The villagers in turn chase him
                away with broomsticks. I can only imagine that it could be the inner necessity of Usopp to gain
                attention in any way whatsoever possible.
                <br />
                <br />
                The insecurity that it entails can only be imagined with great sorrow. He should be scared almost always
                and as a result, be a weak personality earning love that he could not get from his parents. And any
                child lies it is the parents that guide the children to not lie but to say the truth but Usopp does not
                have such a person and incorporates lying into his personality and becomes a person who almost always
                lies every day of his life.
                <br />
                <br />
                While in Syrup village he dreams of one day traveling the seas just like his father. Not once in the
                900+ episodes that I had seen have I seen Usopp resent having such a father who had left him and never
                returned.
                <br />
                <br />
                It is only seen as if he is proud of his father and follows his father's brave footsteps. It is seen
                when the Luffy Pirates enter the grand line. They each make a vow and the vow that Usopp makes is to
                become a brave warrior of the sea.
                <br />
                <br />
                He had spoiled his reputation so much that when the real pirate tries to kill his best friend Kaya and
                take all the wealth for himself and nobody in the village believes him including Kaya and as a result,
                Kaya slaps Usopp thereby ending their relationship.
                <br />
                <br />
                It seems to be hard for Kaya as the pirate is none other than her personal loyal caretaker Klahadore.
                <br />
                <br />
                Finally, the Luffy pirates come to the rescue when dealing with Klahadore.
                <br />
                <br />
                As a result, Kaya provides the Luffy pirates with the Going Merry which Usopp cares about with his life
                and soul until the going merry could no longer be repaired.
                <br />
                <br />
                Usopp's core character is also the reluctance to see the truth and acknowledging the truth forces one to
                deal with it. It is often the weakest of the characters who choose not to see the truth and keep
                themselves drenched in the deception. It’s a mark of brilliance from the authors of one piece when the
                Going Merry could not be repaired this information is shared with Usopp.
                <br />
                <br />
                And his first reaction is rejection. That cannot be true and he fights with Luffy and a fierce exchange
                of Words bring Usopps core insecurity while Sanji tries to stop them, the damage is already done. Usopp
                says that he is extremely useless in the battle. Everyone says things that cannot be taken back during a
                fierce argument and that seems to be exactly what is happening during the conflict between Luffy and
                Usopp.
                <br />
                <br />
                Every insecurity that Usopp has is forced to the surface and Usopp is seen to be the most self-centered
                during the conflict. They decide to fight it out for the Going Merry with a time and place to fight.
                <br />
                <br />
                Never before have we ever seen Usopp go all out but this time he goes all out on Luffy. His captain and
                he loses because of course Luffy is stronger than Usopp and leaves the crew.
                <br />
                <br />
                Usopp still stays inside the Going Merry when the others rent out a place in water seven. This conflict
                affects the morale of the whole crew and everyone misses Usopp but what has happened had happened and
                they couldn’t do anything about it.
                <br />
                <br />
                Usopp feeling insecure about going back to the crew wears a Sogeking mask and fools Luffy and chopper
                that he is Sogeking a friend of Usopp, that he has come to offer his hand in Enies Lobby to free Robin
                who has been taken hostage to build Pluton by decrypting the ancient texts.
                <br />
                <br />
                Usopp's insecurity and inability to face the crew is shown when he puts on the mask to become Sogeking
                and every other member of the crew who understood that it is Usopp behind the mask plays along
                preserving the dignity of Usopp.
                <br />
                <br />
                Usopp is seen as a person who has a false ego, a person who never encounters the truth at its face value
                (opposite of Luffy) and as a result lies about everything. Of course, such a person has a weak
                personality and is not confident about his ability to achieve anything big.
                <br />
                <br />
                After all the events Usopp still schemes about all the lies that he could say and all the imaginary
                conversations with Luffy to get back to the crew and none of which had anything to do with confronting
                Luffy and saying sorry for disobeying a direct order from the captain to abandon this ship and get a new
                one.
                <br />
                <br />
                Ultimately Usopp is a character who refuses to see the truth until or unless he is forced to confront
                the reality, When the Thousand Sunny leaves shore without him Usopp breaks down to apologize to Luffy.
                It is the act of confronting the truth which brings Usopp back to Luffy pirates.
                <br />
                <br />
                It also shows how much Luffy loves his crew and is willing to let go when one of his crew members makes
                a mistake and confronts him to apologize to him. A true leader forgives his people genuinely without
                expecting anything in return. As long as the Crew believes in Luffy, Luffy is sure to succeed. It is
                also seen as a true misery when they leave his crew and it leaves Usopp destroyed from within.
                <br />
                <br />
                It is not like you leave the crew and feel happy that you left the crew. The same happens to Robin and
                Sanji as well when they are forced and blackmailed to leave the crew. It shows that the crew is genuine
                in its intent to gather the people who have their dream of becoming something bigger than what they are
                now.
                <br />
                <br />
                In that sense, Usopp's mission is as noble as Luffy's. It is not a 1: 1 comparison of Luffy and Usopp
                and such a comparison is just not fair as well. Luffy had Garp, Ace, Sabo, and Mountain Bandits while
                Usopp had nobody.
                <br />
                <br />
                Who knows how hard it is for a child to grow without any emotional support from the elders and the
                emotional support of your friends. Luffy had mountain bandits as guardians, Garp as his adopted
                grandfather, and Ace and Sabo as younger brothers and friends who have a dream of becoming the best
                pirates the world has to offer. They are confident that they have a bright future as their fathers are
                great warriors of the Sea.
                <br />
                <br />
                While Usopp just has one thing in common where his father traveled the seas to become the greatest
                sharpshooter the world of pirates has to offer. He took the only thing, the only hope available to him,
                and integrated it into him. Now his dream is to become the greatest warrior of the sea. It is as noble a
                dream as the rest of them.
                <br />
                <br />
                But no matter how he tries he is a victim of the past and is eternal afraid to die. It can be seen in
                Dressrosa when Robin and Tontatta warriors are turned into toys to serve as a slave for eternity to
                Donquixote Doflamingo and family, Usopp runs for his life leaving Robin and the rest to suffer their
                worst fate. Yes, Robin made a mistake by trying to hold Sugar but who doesn't. I truly hated Usopp for
                his cowardice when he was running for his life from Sugar and Trebol. God, Fear of death in general is
                acceptable but not when you have promised that you are there to the rest of them and choose to run
                instead of staying to fight and die he has to. God! it is so easy for us to say that is the right thing
                to do and he didn't, Would I be doing the same thing in the face of death. Who knows!
                <br />
                <br />
                We are talking about Usopp now, He wants to be the brave warrior of the sea, A brave warrior embraces
                his fear of death and conquers it, That is what we in the latter when the Tonttatta tribe cheers for
                their leader Usoland (Usopp). One of the grand lies Usopp has said to Tonttatta tribes, That he was the
                warrior who is going to bring salvation to Tonttatta tribes and he was indeed the descendant of Noland
                (whom Tonttatta tribes expects to be their savior one day).
                <br />
                <br />
                We can finally see Usopp conquering his fear of death and embracing it. We can see it from his attitude
                when he returns. And Trebol says "You should have just kept running". Usopp tries his best to defeat
                both Sugar and Trebol but fails. but in that failure and suffering, he manages to scare Sugar
                unconscious. A lucky break that the war in Dressrosa badly needs. And from then on, even though Usopp is
                on the brink of death he is considered God Usopp.
                <br />
                <br />
                We truly see Usopp transforming into the brave warrior of the sea that he badly needs to be. the lie and
                deception slowly fade into the background when he starts confronting enemies stronger than him. We can
                see him running away for a while trying to lure enemies away but he doesn't run, hide or abandon their
                comrades. He is just in the background waiting for the right moment for him to be of use to the Luffy
                pirates.
                <br />
                <br />
                We can see that in Dressrosa when Usopp tries to save both Luffy and Trafalgar Law from Sugar by scaring
                Sugar the second time by using his sniper skills. And he is damn good at it as well. It is when he
                focuses with all his might with a picture-perfect clarity that if he fails the whole war effort would
                have been for nothing and that Luffy would be serving as a toy slave for the rest of his life, An
                outcome that Usopp could not imagine happening. It is then he starts focusing to hit Sugar that he is
                finally able to land a successful shot to scare Sugar.
                <br />
                <br />
                In some ways seeing the weak transform into a reasonably strong person is more attractive than seeing
                the strong becoming stronger. Maybe it reflects all the weakness that still exists inside of us and how
                we could also possibly overcome those things. It's a possibility.
