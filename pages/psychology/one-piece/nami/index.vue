              <h3 class="title">Nami is an interesting character...</h3>
              <p>
                She is an orphan adopted by Bellemere a retired marine officer who is
                very tough on her adopted children.
                <br />
                <br />
                Nami is raised by Bellemere in the house outskirts of the village of Cocoyashi where she is very poor.
                As a result, Nami has to steal books from the library to learn navigation. Although the source of the
                inspiration is not known just like the Sanji. She happens to want to be the world's best navigator who
                charts the entire seas.
                <br />
                <br />
                She also happens to be very good at it since her childhood. The first scene in the one Piece starts with
                the camera focusing on Nami. As she is very busy trying to steal the money (Berry) from the ship.
                <br />
                <br />
                She is being introduced to us as a person who is very good at stealing. She is charming and uses her
                charismatic character to find a way to sneak and steal all the money from the ships she focuses on.
                <br />
                <br />
                It is later known that she has made a pact with the Arlong pirates to free her village from them. It so
                happens that Arlong seeing her skills in charting the maps forces her to join the Arlong pirates.
                <br />
                <br />
                When Arlong captures her village Cocoyashi he threatens to kill everyone who is unwilling to pay him
                100,000 Berry for every adult and 50,000 Berry for every child in the village. The whole village tries
                to hide Bellemere from Arlong but Arlong notices the fire coming out of the chimney and goes to
                Bellemeres house trying to force her to cough up the above-mentioned Berry as a fee for them having to
                stay alive.
                <br />
                <br />
                But Bellemere being poor only has around 100,000 Berry, enough to protect her two adopted children from
                certain death so she chooses to sacrifice herself instead of her children.
                <br />
                <br />
                It leaves both Nami and Nojiko scared forever. It can be seen when the pirate ship Luffy always orange
                trees. Bellemare's primary source of income and Nami s attachment to her are reflected in the ship. It
                also gives thousand Sunny and Going Merry enormous emotional value which would otherwise be missing if
                there were no personal elements in the ships.
                <br />
                <br />
                Having been utterly destroyed by the recent loss of her mother and been forced into the Arlong Pirates.
                Nami a child agrees with the Arlong pirates to free her village if she pays 100 million berries to them.
                <br />
                <br />
                A noble pact but Arlong also uses her in the meantime to chart the seas and he is planning on charting
                the entire oceans with the Nami which can be seen from the charts stacked in her room in Arlong Park.
                <br />
                <br />
                The uncanny resemblance of Arlong Park to the Sabaody Park just speaks about the hatred the fish-men
                have over the humans in general and the superiority they feel overall humans.
                <br />
                <br />
                They cannot be blamed it is a natural reflex of an untrained mind to do upon others what others do upon
                them. As such Arlong after escaping from slavery by humans decides to rule over humans in the East Blue
                and starts to claim all the villages in east blue.
                <br />
                <br />
                The navy from the world government is also seen as corrupt and they receive monthly payments from Arlong
                to tolerate his reign over the villages of the East Blue. That leaves the people of villages controlled
                by Arlong with immense suffering.
                <br />
                <br />
                It is also later seen that the Celestial Dragons do the same to the villages near them and the people
                near the MarieJois have to pay tribute to the celestial dragons and as such forever poor as a result.
                <br />
                <br />
                It can be seen that one is identical to the other and the only difference is that a small group of
                pirates is ruling over the East blue without an official authority but people suffer nonetheless.
                <br />
                <br />
                Under such environments a Nami is inevitable and however noble she might initially have been would be
                eventually forced to do dishonorable things under dishonorable authority to stay alive.
                <br />
                <br />
                After being the third member of the Straw hat pirates while Luffy fights Don Krieg near Baratie, Nami
                steals the Going Merry. Unlike in the past, she starts missing the crew while stealing the Going Merry.
                <br />
                <br />
                That shows the contradiction and conflict inside her where she is forced to do something wrong for the
                good of the whole village.
                <br />
                <br />
                She can find Luffy and others only because she is in the business of stealing but while trying to obtain
                the confidence of the crew she falls in love with the crew and is moved by their trustworthiness which
                is probably the source of her misery while trying to loot Luffy and his crew.
                <br />
                <br />
                Sometimes opportunities present themselves for salvation even for those who seem unworthy. Luffy goes to
                get back his ship and Nami after defeating Krieg only to find out that the situation is pretty
                complicated.
                <br />
                <br />
                The loyalty to the Luffy pirates is shown when Nami releases Zoro from Arlong Park and when she pretends
                to kill Usopp and pushes him to the ocean. This goodness inside of her is her original character and she
                puts on a mask in front of Arlong Pirates posing as an immoral person who hates the world and wants to
                destroy everything but all the while all she wants to do is to gather 100 million berries to save her
                village from despair.
                <br />
                <br />
                This leaves Liffy pirates in confusion and that confusion is clarified by Nami's sister Nojiko who
                explains clearly that it is the first time Nami has had a good time while on a journey which is when she
                was with Luffy Pirates and explains Nami's past.
                <br />
                <br />
                After Nami is deceived by Arlong when he sends the Navy to confiscate the 100 Million berries that she
                had saved, Nami breaks down and strays to scar herself. It is when she breaks that her character is
                shown the true goodness that she is and the fact that she regretted doing all the wrong things for
                Arlong Pirates.
                <br />
                <br />
                Luffy being him saves the whole village by defeating Arlong and releasing Nami from Arlong, And as a
                result, Nami joins the Luffy pirates again permanently.
                <br />
                <br />
                a source of brilliance by the author of the one-piece is that every member of the Luffy pirates had to
                fight their past and break free from it to move towards the possibility of achieving their dream.
                <br />
                <br />
                God! Thatâ€™s so true! Who in the world has ever accomplished anything while living in their parent's home
                all their lives.
                <br />
                <br />
                As a result, it is a precondition and a pre-requirement for all the members to be free from any chains
                and the stroke of brilliance by the authors of One piece is that Luffy seems to be the one relieving
                them from the present misery thereby liberating them from the misery of the present and the past,
                therefore, Enabling them to pursue their dream.
                <br />
                <br />
                Nami is one among them along with Sanji, Robin, Franky, and Jimbei.
                <br />
                <br />
                Amazingly, a lot of life lessons can be learned from animation series.
                <br />
                <br />
                After this Nami is seen as a planner and fills a role that is much needed in the Luffy pirates. Someone
                with a planning capability and someone who has seen the underworld and sees deception.
                <br />
                <br />
                She is also weak and almost always runs with Usopp when Luffy and Zoro fight the enemy in the early
                episodes but after a while, it is Nami who asks Usopp to make a weapon in order to support Luffy pirates
                with the fight even as a supporting role.
