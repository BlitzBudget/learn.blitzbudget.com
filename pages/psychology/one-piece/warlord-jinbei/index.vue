                            <p>
                                now a part of the Straw hat pirate crew is
                                one of the noblest of characters in One Piece.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Luffy finds Jinbei locked up in Level 6 of Impel down when he tries to rescue Portez D.
                                Ace. Jinbei is locked because he refuses to fight the white bear's pirates during the
                                paramount wars. Jinbei asks Luffy to release him and Luffy takes a look at Jinbei for
                                about a minute and decides to free him.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                I was wondering what might Luffy be thinking when he was judging Jinbei by his words and
                                looks. Come to think of it, he might have tried to rely on his instinct to judge their
                                personality. Jinbeis's voice is also very deep as such seems truthful, noble, and brave.
                                He is all of those.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                When they escape from Impel Down, he proves to be a good strategist as well. He backs
                                Luffy up and rescues him during tight spots even while escaping from Impel Down by
                                hijacking Warships from the navy. It shows that he can back his words up with his
                                fish-men karate.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                A fish-men bogged down by huge responsibility for his action. It can be seen when the
                                Straw hat pirates go to the fish-men island and Jinbei confessed to Nami. It shows a
                                person taking responsibility for his actions. Every action has its effect and it may be
                                good or bad but you will have to be strong enough to own up for your actions.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                So he starts with the Sun Pirates which Jinbei and Arlong were part. We can see the
                                split in their personality when Jinbei protests Arlongs behavior whenever he shows signs
                                of hatred and despising the humans. When Jinbei believes in piece and collaboration even
                                though the world government enslaved fish-men and sold the mermaids to the highest
                                bidder.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                When Tiger dies because the humans betrayed him because of the general hatred towards
                                the fish-men, we can see Arlong propagating hatred towards all humans which eventually
                                gets him enslaved near Redline while Jinbei propagates toward peace and collaboration
                                which enables him to become the only fish-men warlord approved by the World Government.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Later Jinbei frees all the fish-men slaves just like Tiger who had saved Boa Hancock and
                                other fish-men equally. One such person freed was Arlong. Later Arlong goes to the East
                                Blue to enslave lots of human villages and one such village was Namis village of
                                Cocoyashi. For this, Nami has suffered horrendously and lost her only adopted parent
                                Bellemere.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Jinbei profoundly confesses to Nami but he doesn't expect to be pardoned. He simply
                                wanted to confess the truth to Nami. At the end of the confession, we can see Sanji
                                furiously angry but Nami says it’s ok and it’s anyway not Jinbeis fault but Arlongs and
                                nothing could be done about it.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Later Jinbei does not want the straw hat pirates to save the fish-men's village which is
                                a fair judgment considering that would only bring more hatred towards humans when all
                                Jinbei wants is just the opposite, peace and tranquility among fish-men and humans.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                His goal seems to be noble, to survive he joins Big Mom pirates and serves under her.
                                When Luffy asks Jinbei to join his crew. He initially declined but promises to join
                                later.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Jinbei is also a man of his words and as seen later instead of running away from Big Mom
                                he confronts Big Mom and plays the life or death game and wins his life and leaves the
                                Big Mom Pirates to join the Straw hats later. It shows his tenacity to confront the
                                truth even though it could pose a certain death to him and come back victorious.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                His response to not fearing why he didn’t have one ounce of fear was “I am going to
                                serve the pirate who is going to become a king of pirates, if you think I fear an
                                emperor of the sea then I have no right to be a part of his crew”.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                A very rare trait so far seen only with a bare minority of the people in the One Piece
                                world one among which is Luffy himself who dares to smile when confronted with death.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                A person who confronts death with his face chin-up has to have utmost clarity of what he
                                wants in his life and where he wants to be. There is an act of faith, willpower, and
                                tenacity in having the audacity to dream big and say it out aloud.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Initially, when Luffy says that he wants to be the king of pirates people laugh at him
                                but in the new world when he utters those words people take him seriously and want to
                                stop him. It shows that even though people laugh at you now, keep going until you meet
                                powerful enough who are pursuing the same goal and are strong enough to dream big.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Somehow Jinbei also seems to be a reject of the world even though he is loved among the
                                fish-men for his nobility but had to gain the acceptance of the world government by
                                becoming a warlord.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                It shows that no matter what you are doing right now there is a path to salvation and
                                truth. It could be a really hard path to choose but it is possible. Some of these
                                characters never laugh and never cry, when Pedro sacrifices himself to save the Thousand
                                Sunny and the straw hat crew Jinbei stays laser-focused on the goal.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                He explains that Pedro sacrificed himself so we could save ourselves it would not be
                                fair to him if we moan his death and get caught. God! Well said. It takes such strength
                                to become a person that strong who sees the truest of intent and aims the strength to
                                achieve them.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Finally, when Big Mom lands on the Thousand Sunny it is Jinbei who throws her out to
                                prevent the ship from being destroyed.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                He also requests Luffy to let him save his previous crew from annihilation by letting
                                Jinbei go and fight with them. It shows about a person is willing to take responsibility
                                for other people's actions and not let other people sacrifice themselves and be a person
                                who sees it without doing something about it.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                A king of pirates requires a man who is true to his word, noble, and does everything in
                                his power to negotiate with the enemy of the enemy to do the right thing.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                It is a hard job negotiation and we can see him going it acting as an intermediator
                                between the fire tank pirates and the straw hats. And controls the whole path of the
                                conversation when they deviate towards intimidation and fight. He is also humble enough
                                to let the captain have the last say and go with whatever Luffy has decided even if it
                                means death. I guess it shows loyalty to his crew.
