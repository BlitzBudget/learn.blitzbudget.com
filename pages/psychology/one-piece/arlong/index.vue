              <h3 class="title">One considered as a member of the Sun Pirates...</h3>
              <p>
                and practically considered as a brother of Jinbei in the
                past before they split. Arlong was the leader who proposed the ideology of hatred and acted upon it and
                as a result became a beacon for those who equally harbored hatred in their heart for all the
                human.
                <br />
                <br />
                Naturally after the death of their captain Tiger, they formed the Arlong pirates and
                ravaged human
                villages. As per Jinbeis account he was a slave before being released by Jinbei. A person who already
                hates all man kind for the atrocities committed against the fishmen was enslaved and even though he was
                released in the end because of Jinbei, his hatred only seemed to have gotten to the point that he wanted
                to act upon it.
                <br />
                <br />
                As a result it feels like hatred became vengeance as a result of slavery,
                vengeance became revenge.
                <br />
                <br /> We can see the revenge in the formation of the Arlong pirates
                only for the purpose of reigning over the
                man kind.
                <br />
                <br /> Revenge no matter how noble only brings one to hell. No amount of suffering
                justifies hurting innocent
                people. A generalized hatred toward all man kind is not justifiable.<br /> <br /> These generalized
                hatred are only possible in real life scenarios with some kind of belief systems where
                the communists consider capitalists as monsters and one religion considers other religion as invalid.
                This seems to be a race discrimination , demonization and reduction. All of this seems happens in real
                life.
                <br />
                <br /> But what we see here is how someone can develop a generalized hatred towards other
                race, religion or
                ideology.
                <br />
                <br /> As a result Nami suffered and lived in hell for the majority of her life, forced
                to betray herself and
                live a life of a thief inorder to save her village. Imagine the misery someone will feel as a result of
                betraying themselves but she did not develop a generalized hatred towards all fish men and not even
                towards Jinbei who freed Arlong and as a result Arlong made a lot of villages suffer for years.
                <br />
                <br />
                This shows the difference between Nami and Arlong. Where she had learnt to isolate the person and
                not
                generalize the character with the whole race. It takes a different level of ideology and belief to
                become that person.
                <br />
                <br /> When people do that they are just focusing all their hatred on the
                innocent because they are weaker than
                Arlong but are not strong enough to fight with the Celestial Dragons and win. In a lot of ways they are
                slaves to their past and cowards who are simply making them feel superior over the weaker ones. Only
                thugs do that!!
                <br />
                <br /> And Arlong wanted to enslave Nami for the rest of her life because she was
                so good at charting maps.
                That is true enslavement against their will. I don’t think it is the best way to navigate in the world.
                It would make people not trust on their own crew.
                It seems that what happens and Nami is requested to prove her allegiance to Arlong pirates by killing
                Usopp.
                <br />
                <br />
                Nami only needs to make the Arlong pirates think that she killed Usopp but we can’t
                blame her as well
                because Usopp was forced into a corner and would have been killed anyway.
                <br />
                <br /> Arlong does not
                flinch killing another human but is devastated when he sees fishmen in the brink of
                death and gets really aggravated seeing the state of Arlong park. It shows his ego and his care for the
                fishmen but a demon to humans would get exactly that in return for destroying all the villages he is in
                control over.
                <br />
                <br /> He is also Cunning enough to ask 100,000 berry for every adult and 50,000
                berry for every children for
                them to stay alive. I am pretty sure that this ideology was copied from the Celestial Dragons a where
                they request a royalty for staying in MarieJois.
                <br />
                <br /> Arlong has a dream of becoming a pirate
                who has charted all the seas with the help of Nami and becoming
                even stronger to as much territory as possible.
                <br />
                <br /> Inorder to continue to stay in power he
                bribes the navy. The bribery is also an act of corrupting the
                existing system and not shying from propagating what is wrong inorder to get what Arlong wants.
                <br />
                <br />
                All of this makes him propagate hatred out to the entire world and ensure generalized suffering
                to
                everyone weaker than him. This alone is enough to ensure that he would not survive for long with this
                attitude. Luffy seems to be the one who defeats Arlong and frees the villages in control of Arlong.
