                Some of the most easy-to-understand characters...
              </h3>
              <p>
                in One piece is Roronova Zoro. He is portrayed as a personality
                who wants to be the world's greatest swordsman.
                <br />
                <br />
                He is also driven by an aim to be the best at what he does like
                the rest of the Straw hat crew. It is a trait that can be seen
                across the straw hat crew even though Nico Robin and Soul King
                do not explicitly mention them, their actions and hard work make
                it evident.
                <br />
                <br />
                Zoro seems to be a calm level headed character who wants very
                few things to get going but overdoes all of them.
                <br />
                <br />
                He sleeps a lot, drinks a lot, and trains a lot.
                <br />
                <br />
                Another person who seems to keep his word. Some of the only
                characters which Luffy directly convinces to join by initially
                rejects but Luffy seems to be more persistent and finally, Zoro
                gives in.
                <br />
                <br />
                If he sees an enemy with a sword rest assured Zoro will be the
                one fighting that character and all the free time that Zoro has
                would be spent on sleeping and the reminder on training,
                drinking, or finding the way back after getting lost.
                <br />
                <br />
                For a strong-willed person who trains every chance he gets, he
                seems to be the one without a sense of direction. And every time
                Sanji picks on Zoro, they both start to fight. Almost like the
                relationship that Zoro and Sanji have is through fighting,
                taunting, and making fun of each other.
                <br />
                <br />
                They even seem to be fighting sometimes while fighting their
                enemy. Zoro is the type who gets annoyed with Sanji and somehow
                that seems to take priority over defeating the enemy even though
                for a very short time.
                <br />
                <br />
                An interesting character indeed but interestingly is never seen
                to be drunk like a fish ever. A fast learner when it comes to
                sword fighting by motivating himself to be increasingly better
                every single time and always finding a way of increasingly
                tougher situations like when fighting Mr 1 in Alabasta.
                <br />
                <br />
                His integrity shows when he takes his captains' words as gospel,
                in fact, more than any other member of the crew and when Usopp
                fights with Luffy in Water Seven and leaves the group. It is
                Zoro who reminds Luffy that any member of the crew who disobeys
                the Captain cannot be taken back as it would undermine the
                captain.
                <br />
                <br />
                Luffy and Sanji immediately seem to understand where Zoro is
                coming from and agree that if the first thing Usopp says when
                seeing Luffy is an apology they would take him in and when the
                Thousand Sunny leaves the shore without Usopp everyone is
                disappointed that Usopp never wanted to join his crew. But Usopp
                typical of his character starts with his lies which Zoro, Luffy,
                and Sanji conveniently do not hear until Usopp apologizes.
                <br />
                <br />
                It shows that at the same time they are willing to pardon Usopp
                for his naive lies as they know, trust and miss Usopp. It all
                shows how much they value their crew and regard them as friends
                or even family.
                <br />
                <br />
                Another instance when Zoro shows his character is when he begs
                the current world's best swordsman Hawk-Eye to train him because
                Luffy requested all of his crew to become stronger and meet them
                in Sabaody Arc. Hawk-Eye gets disappointed in Zoro initially
                when he begs but understands that he is doing it for someone
                else so he agrees to train him. The irony in all of this is that
                Zoro wants to be trained by Hawk Eye for Zoro to be the world's
                best swordsman by killing Hawk Eye.
                <br />
                <br />
                Zoro wants to be stronger and sucks up his ego because of his
                loyalty to the captain and does what is necessary to become
                stronger with what he has at that time! If it is the enemy who
                has to train him so be it!
                <br />
                <br />
                All these moments convey Zoro as a person who is a very strong,
                fiercely loyal, and trustable person. There is no mystery there.
                <br />
                <br />
                The extent of closeness to Sanji is shown in the thriller bark
                while encountering Kuma. When Zoro realizes that there is a
                no-win situation and they are doomed to fail and Kuma is going
                to arrest Luffy. Zoro sacrifices himself instead of Luffy and
                strikes a bargain with Kuma. Sanji realizing all of this comes
                to Zoroâ€™s rescue and Zoro bashes Sanji unconscious and indeed
                successfully negotiated his sacrifice which leaves Zoro on the
                brink of death. The extent of the injury is evident when he
                needs to be taken care of by Negative Hollow after so many days
                and is required to recuperate for two weeks before starting to
                be trained by Hawk Eye.
                <br />
                <br />
                Zoro is ready to sacrifice himself for the sake of the whole
                crew and a person who is willing to sacrifice himself for others
                is the highest virtue possible among all the virtue. And it is
                this character that makes him the most reliable character in all
                of the straw hat crew along with the protagonist Luffy.
                <br />
                <br />
                His strength as a personality and reliability is shown when
                Usopp leaves the crew in Water Seven and Zoro is the first to
                recover and move on while providing a strong place to rely on
                for others.
                <br />
                <br />
                All these traits make him one of the most easy-to-understand,
                clear characters whose traits would ensure that he would indeed
                one day become the world's best swordsman. What is the use of
                the world's best swordsman if he is constantly not putting
                himself in danger for the betterment of everyone around him and
                as an extension the whole world? And such a strong person should
                also be reliable, loyal, and strong and could see through the
                lies.
