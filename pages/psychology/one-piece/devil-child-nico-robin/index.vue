              <h3 class="title">More mysterious than Sanji...</h3>
              <p>
                I think Nico Robin will be connecting Luffy with the Revolutionary army in
                the future as Nico Robin was training with the Revolutionary army for 2 years.
                <br />
                <br />
                Nico Robin is the best example of a somebody who is complicated. She has the devil inside of her that
                can kill everyone except her whenever she joins a crew. I think it is unfair to say that she was
                naturally a devil. It was the act of the world government to put a huge bounty of 79 Million Berry when
                she was just 8 years old.
                <br />
                <br />
                No wonder people started pursuing her for the bounty. She started attracting all the bounty hunters and
                that would eventually have made her the way she is. Who can blame her? Imagine a child being pursued by
                the whole world because she is considered a devil. The whole world thinks that she destroyed six
                warships when all she did was learn about an ancient language to decipher the Poneglyph.
                <br />
                <br />
                All she did! Ha! That’s one hell of a thing to do! Considering that she can obtain information about the
                lost era which has the potential to topple the world government. Makes reassurance that information is
                the world's strongest weapon against injustice. And Robin had that potential to be the catalyst. No
                wonder Dragon and his army were interested in her and took her in to train her to be even more powerful
                in the 2 years when the whole Luffy crew were scattered to become stronger and reunite again in Sabaody
                Archipelago.
                <br />
                <br />
                Yes, any tyrant would hold information as a weapon and prevent it from the general population if it has
                a detrimental image to the tyrant. The world government even has a king in MarieJois who decides the
                fate of the whole world even though nobody in the one-piece world knows about it.
                <br />
                <br />
                Anyone living in this hell would have to turn into a monster and not trust anyone but serve their
                self-interest to survive.
                <br />
                <br />
                It can be from the beginning that Miss All Sunday of Baroque works (Robin) from the days of Arabasta
                helps Luffy in a myriad of ways to topple Crocodile (The president of Baroque works).
                <br />
                <br />
                That is the true meaning of someone plotting their path even though they are a part of something big
                (Baroque works) in this case. It cannot be seen as anything other than a selfish act when what you want
                contradicts what you serve. Such a character indeed exists within Robin which is why Aokiji tries to
                kill Robin but Robin narrowly escapes because of the Straw hats crew.
                <br />
                <br />
                But Robin always wants to find a crew that loves her and wants to fit into it because she knows that in
                such a place her soul could be calm and happy. But such a world is almost non-existent in the world of
                pirates where the rejects of the world exist.
                <br />
                <br />
                But Luffy is different when he has a dream and wants to achieve it by following the path of truth and
                genuine friendship rather than deception, betrayal, power, and greed.
                <br />
                <br />
                We can truly see how clever Robin is when she navigates the underworld in new islands and obtains key
                information to topple the evil tyrant. In Dressrosa it was the Tonttatta tribes, while Luffy and others
                were captured by Accino and family, we can see Robin navigating freely by handling Lily smartly and
                saving everyone.
                <br />
                <br />
                It is a negative character to manipulate people used positively to save the members of her crew. It is
                not manipulation in a negative way when someone is trying to kill all of you for your bounty right? And
                nothing is right or wrong in that domain. This is why we see a lot of the emperors and warlords of the
                sea as manipulative and cunning.
                <br />
                <br />
                But the Straw Hat crews seem to have a line that they wouldn’t cross but that line is somewhere between
                manipulating to kill someone for fun vs manipulating people to find out their true motive and escaping
                from the deception and defeating the enemy in a fair one on one duel for freedom.
                <br />
                <br />
                So we do not see Robin's act as an act of manipulation but as a smart strategy to save the Straw hat
                crews, if not for Robin the whole crew might have died twice over or been captured by the world
                government and sent to Impel Down. So she plays a key role in One Piece.
                <br />
                <br />
                Such a character who has seen the worst and lived and bathed in the underworld is necessary for the
                Straw Hats because they have an eye for the evil which the naive don’t.
                <br />
                <br />
                Even though Robin is overlooked in the Straw Hat crew, I think it is what Robin wants. Robin wants to be
                overlooked so she can navigate the underworld undetected until it is too late. In many ways, she is the
                opposite of Luffy and a necessity as Luffy always gets into trouble.
                <br />
                <br />
                Such a character has its limitation but CP9 tries to blackmail her in Water Seven by threatening to kill
                all of the Straw Hats. And Robin chooses to give in to Save the Straw Hats from sure annihilation as she
                knows that CP9 could be too much for the Straw hats.
                <br />
                <br />
                Who wouldn’t sacrifice themselves for their loved one's man! You can gather a crew that doesn’t give a
                damn about you but such a crew cannot imagine the captain becoming the king of anything.
                <br />
                <br />
                It takes a tight knight crew that provides a safe harbor to its crew members and always protects them in
                case they get abducted. It is like Navy Seal right, Never leave anybody, recover every soldier no matter
                what! No excuses!
                <br />
                <br />
                It’s such a selfless desire to care for their crew that sets the Straw Hats apart and Luffys' ability to
                forgive the old enemies once they have truly changed like Bellamy.
                <br />
                <br />
                That is the true meaning of friendship in an environment where everything is trying to kill you. They
                wouldn’t last a day if they were alone yet they are so strong together United by a single focus provided
                by Luffy. It is Luffy who unites all of the Straw hats not because of his leadership skills but
                something much more than that.
                <br />
                <br />
                It’s a promise to be a Family and the protection that the family called Strawhat pirates can offer.
                There is nothing more meaningful than a selfless act that benefits your family. So Robin decides to
                sacrifice herself for the greater good but Luffy and others take Robin back from Enies Lobby by
                declaring war with the World Government.
                <br />
                <br />
                It is when they all go back to Water Seven that Aokiji is convinced that Robin has truly found her place
                this time and in fact, it was not a mistake to help her escape 20 years ago when the small village of
                O’Hara was destroyed by a Buster Call.
                Aokiji believed the words of his best friend at that time Saul.
                <br />
                <br />
                A kid is nothing but potential and it is unfair to kill a child because of the potential that she could
                somehow topple the world government. it is the fear of that potential by the world government that has
                made Robin who she is today. Sometimes the fear will push others in the direction that you do not want
                them to go and make it a self-fulfilling prophecy. We can see that happening with Robin.
                <br />
                <br />
                It’s a tragedy in the truest sense of the world that Robin was forced to suffer for twenty years and a
                whole village was destroyed because of her mother whose mission was also to decipher the Poneglyph.
