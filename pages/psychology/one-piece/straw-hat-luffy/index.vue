              <h3 class="title">A 17-year-old boy from a small town...</h3>
              <p>
                in East Blue sets off on a journey to become a pirate. In this
                hypothetical world like the real one, all the pirates are
                considered bad.
                <br />
                <br />
                However, Luffy’s intention is not to spread suffering but to
                attain a treasure that Gold D. Roger had left for everyone to
                pursue ( Which is the only way to become King of all pirates).
                It has been his childhood dream that Garp (his grandfather)
                disapproves of.
                <br />
                <br />
                Luffy is not greedy about the treasure there is no indication
                that one piece is in fact money. It could be something different
                entirely. He seems to be a happy character who is always
                laughing and enjoys small victories. We can see in his eyes that
                he is light-hearted during a friendly conversation.
                <br />
                <br />
                Always assumes that everyone is friendly, believes every word
                that everybody says. We can see this early on as he believes
                every lie Usopp says which is a white lie.
                <br />
                <br />
                Luffy as a character seems to be extremely susceptible to
                manipulation and often gets into too much trouble as he is the
                captain. It is a direct result of his straightforward character.
                <br />
                <br />
                He says what he means and never lies. If he says something he
                would either accomplish the task or die trying. Also, he seems
                to be incapable of not involving himself in fixing a problem for
                someone he considers a friend.
                <br />
                <br />
                His strong suit seems to be his happy face, his native approach,
                and his vision of the world. Which is often seen by others as a
                person incapable of harm. And these new friends are always
                surprised when they see his will and dedication of Luffy when he
                fights for something.
                <br />
                <br />
                It is often that Luffy fights for someone else. As in, his fight
                is not a direct result of his selfish desire to attain something
                but is often to help a friend who is bogged down by their past
                or a stranger who is suffering.
                <br />
                <br />
                As a result, he can only be seen as a revolutionary like his
                father Dragon. He almost dies almost always now and then. When
                he does die most often it is their friends and their crew who
                takes care of him and helps him recover. They don’t think twice
                before risking their lives but on the contrary, they fight to
                risk their lives for Luffy.
                <br />
                <br />
                Even though, it seems too less. It seems like he deserves more.
                And every time he recruits someone, he asks them, and only if
                they want to be a part of the crew he recruits them. He often
                waits for a response and keeps his words even though he risks
                his life and the life of his crewmates like in Alabasta while
                waiting for a reply from Viví (Miss Wednesday). And she said No.
                <br />
                <br />
                More often than necessary he is always confronted with an enemy
                that is much stronger than him. He never imagined if he would
                win the fight or not. He often goes to a fight without knowing
                the full extent of his enemy's strength. And as a result, he
                often encounters situations in which he is beaten to a pulp and
                is almost always destined to die. Then it is a friend or a
                stranger or a crew who saves him.
                <br />
                <br />
                He is emotionally driven and with the right sense of instinct to
                guide him. So his sense of justice is often the reason to pick a
                fight with an enemy. Everything else does not matter. He always
                gets back up when he is seemingly destroyed. That shows his will
                to endure powered by a strong sense of justice.
                <br />
                <br />
                That brings him to Enies lobby to take his crewmate, Nico Robin,
                back. At all costs, even though Nico Robin says she wants to die
                and does not want to do anything do with the Straw Hat pirates.
                He refuses to take No for an answer. It is as if he sees through
                the lie that Robin says. No, he is not that smart but he chooses
                to trust his crewmates with his life even though he doesn’t know
                anything about her.
                <br />
                <br />
                It makes sense as Nico Robin saved Luffy’s life twice in
                Alabasta. The crew doesn’t know anything about Nico Robin and
                the world government seems to paint Nico Robin as a character
                who manipulates, and as someone immoral who is ready to deceive
                their crew. Even as someone capable of deceiving, Luffy’s
                undeniable trust in his crew has the potential to change the
                evilest of characters into the best as it is the most powerful
                personality one can have.
                <br />
                <br />
                Luffy, however, does not trust everyone equally and is
                instinctively capable of selecting the right crewmates who are
                inclined to become loyal crew, friends, and family.
                <br />
                <br />
                The enemies of Luffy are often immoral characters who are
                willing to do anything to attain what they want. The villain is
                often the character who is unjust and spreads suffering to other
                people for the selfish benefit of one’s gain. A person who
                fights such a character is supposed to be the anti-villain or
                the hero who saves everyone.
                <br />
                <br />
                The hero is also the person who is strong and saves someone else
                from a villain and prevents unnecessary suffering. This
                character seems to be ingrained in Luffy.
                <br />
                <br />
                During the fight against the World Government when everyone
                warns him not to go to Impel down to save his brother Portez D
                Ace. All the has to say is “If I do not go I will regret it”. He
                goes anyway with the help of Hancock. Hancock however is madly
                in love with Luffy of his apparent lack of ability to fall in
                love with her and his ability to help Hancock sisters from
                exposing their past even when they were trying to kill Luffy.
                <br />
                <br />
                He is fiercely loyal. It can be seen when Ace his brother is
                killed in front of him by Admiral Sakazuki. He cries so much and
                so loud that the trauma of his brother dying renders him
                unconscious. And as soon as he wakes up his first reaction is
                denial. Denial that his brother has died and this refusal make
                him partly destroy the forest of Amazon Lily. He had to
                recollect that he still had his 7 crewmates to count on which
                helped him come back to his normal senses.
                <br />
                <br />
                All of these portray Luffy as a personality who trusts his crew
                with his life, loves food, and is a person who barges in and
                fights for someone once he is convinced that he is doing the
                right thing. In a lot of sense, the whole crew completes and
                complements Luffy. They make him complete.
