                            <p>
                                it is that you think is the next step in your
                                life cannot be over-emphasized.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Whatever it is that you need to do just get started preparing today no matter how
                                imperfect. Just start. Even if you daily to achieve the goal that you had initially
                                planned. It will just be worth it man! The journey of trying to achieve something that
                                you wanted. And I have one more thing to say about failure.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It is never truly a failure until you give up altogether and quit. Up until then, you
                                are just one step closer to your goal than yesterday.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                All I knew was that I felt like I had a lot to say about the psychological necessity to
                                get started in your financial freedoms. And that was my motivation to delve into
                                psychology and also after a certain point in time, I started seeing too many ways to
                                live their lives and was confused with the absurd number of pathways you could choose to
                                take your life forward.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Life without constraint is just meaningless we would simply be paralyzed by choices if
                                we just did not have clarity of where we wanted to go in life. Therefore a life without
                                a target or a goal is a meaningless life.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I was speaking with one of my uncles during COVID and he mentioned that I have been
                                living my life teaching students for a long and now that I am 50 life just goes on, and
                                it is kind of meaningless.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                That struck me! Many times in life we are in that exact position as my uncle. Feeling a
                                sense of meaningless to everything. And feeling like what’s the point man!! If it was
                                going to end up this way I wouldn’t have done that! That was just pointless.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Some people just extend that to life! As if life has no meaning in itself.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                As Jordan Peterson says, Life is meaningful with the burdens of responsibility that you
                                are willing to shoulder in your life. Else even the most beautiful life would just seem
                                meaningless.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It was like John Calhoun’s utopian rat experiments where all the pointlessness of life
                                let the rats stop caring for their babies and eventually there was a population collapse
                                and pointless.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                But rats can die out of pointlessness but they are not humans, right? We can create
                                meaning in our lives and continue to feel like a fair contributor to our society and
                                family rather than a burden thereby feeling meaningful and being dignified by one’s
                                existence.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                That is probably one of the core reasons that I am right! Maybe! Man! Thinking about it
                                makes me think it may be one of the reasons for me to contribute in some way.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Having said this! That does not mean that staying in a meaningful life is the only right
                                way of living.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Some people choose to live their lives meaningless. And no one else has any right to
                                judge them except themselves right? From their definition, if life is meaningless then
                                you have to be guilty of all the deforestation and the destruction going on in life just
                                to keep you alive. Then it would all seem pointless and you would just want to suicide
                                and end it all! One less person for the earth to carry a burden.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Imagine earth man! It took like 4 billion years to produce an intellectual being with
                                just permutation and combinations. It is just fascinating how just a possible mixture of
                                chemical compounds simply happened to create a single-celled organism and from that to
                                the US was one hell of a journey I am sure.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Do you think all of this was to just accept the whole meaninglessness of life and end
                                it?? Even if we all ended our lives right now, how many more millions or billions of
                                years it would take for the earth to grow another being that is intelligent enough to
                                write this article and question even the existence of meaning in life itself???
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I doubt it would even be possible. Given that we are the only intelligent being in our
                                solar system. We must take it upon ourselves to ensure that we live a full and
                                meaningful life.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The best part is we are not even restrained by the circumstances, man! Imagine being
                                born as a leopard . It’s got to live the rest of its life hunting and living on trees,
                                for the rest of its life only to die in the end and serve as compost for the tree. Your
                                life is not as pointless as a leopard anyway. Why not just live it out and see how it
                                fairs.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Maybe you will find it meaningful and Maybe you will find it worthy to set a target and
                                a worthy goal for yourself and aim high in life.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                If you dared to aim high in life. Don’t whine about it! Just get started. Forget about
                                the planning, forget about sitting on the idea. Just get started. And keep going! One
                                step at a time. And keep trying! Remember you have not failed until you have fully given
                                up on it yourself.
