                            <p>
                                the one you will be in the future. There is no
                                denying it. What others say about you should have no power over you. It only has power
                                when there is doubt. You will only have doubt if you do not have confidence in your
                                ability. You will not have confidence if you do not have experience. You will not have
                                experience if you only keep dreaming. You will stay comfortable suffering for a lifetime
                                if you do not dream.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                That’s all there is to it see you in the next chapter! just kidding. Let’s unwrap that.
                                People put up a lot of walls to prevent themselves from getting hurt, We all do. If they
                                are men they might expect the world to treat them one day, If they are women another.
                                What we had all learned is how to act in such a way to receive what we think we deserve
                                from the world. That is the only possible thing that we all have under our control. As
                                time passes and we might move up or down or stay where we were compared to our past
                                selves. This might also provide a suggestion of we should be treated. I truly believe
                                people must be treated as human beings by how they behave not by how they look.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It doesn't matter what I believe though does it? I already have an opinion about you by
                                the way you carry yourself, how confident you are, how you take care of your body, how
                                your hair looks, and how clear your skin is. What do most people do? They ignore or hide
                                that and put a broad smile on their face. Ignoring that opinion that has already been
                                formed by the subconscious might mean different things under different circumstances.
                                You have to address them at a later point in time by meditation and find out exactly if
                                those pre-judgments, I call them pre-judgments because they are not judged by the
                                conscious self but by the subconsciousness. And that is even more powerful than you
                                might think. It judges everything all the time you might not be conscious of it but it
                                does judge everyone including yourself by the way.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                That is the truest form of the judge there is. Never betray yourself, Never lie to
                                yourself, and Never believe anything without understanding them. A lot of things though
                                seep into us through our friends, families, and random encounters. And slowly we start
                                to act like that, Oh! I forgot the movies and series that we all see, They are also
                                people acting which your subconsciousness sees. We are all related to the core when we
                                see movies and that is the worst of all. It sneaks into our subconscious and hides there
                                forever.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Then slowly manifesting the beliefs that we all hold. How about all married men being
                                tyrannical? Or All married Indian men are tyrannical? I had some of my wife's friends
                                treat me like that. It felt awful. But I know it is not me, It is their projection of
                                how I am, I know I am not. So I took that in, self-reflected on certain things that had
                                happened which might have led them to believe that I could be that and have tried
                                eliminating them in future encounters.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                How about this one? My wife tells me now and then that she is going to be on a diet for
                                X amount of days. I hear her and then say "that's great". Time moves on but I keep
                                watching her if she is keeping her word by following the diet as she told me she would
                                or not. Even though not consciously, When she breaks it, I speak it out aloud. A BIG
                                mistake! What I thought was to remind her to keep her word and motivate her to continue
                                doing it but what I had failed to understand was that she is already beating herself up
                                above and beyond before deciding to break that diet more than anyone could have imagined
                                beating themselves up. Me going in there and telling it out aloud is just the last thing
                                that she wants to hear.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Triggered completely by my belief that she is telling me that she is going to do the
                                diet for keeping her in line. No, she can do that all by herself. She just wants to
                                understand that she is trying to do it and not provoke her by eating foods that are too
                                tempting for her. That's it. Took me a LONG time to figure that one out. The problem
                                with that is that not only should we not do it again but compensate for past mistakes.
                                That is very important.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Even though she is not taking account of all of the wrongdoings on my side consciously.
                                The subconscious takes account. Once you know that, That is absolutely necessary.
                                Imagine this scenario. Someone is constantly hurting you by ignoring you all day and
                                never being there for you when you wanted them but when they want you they call you and
                                pay all the attention in the world until that is done. The stupid narcissist does it
                                like that.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The more sophisticated ones pamper you for a while so you do not find out that you are
                                being used and then go silent. While you are left wondering what you had done. They
                                might come back out again to pamper you with everything for a while only to repeat it
                                again. Took this one from the book called 48 laws of power by Robert Greene. It proves
                                the point though, doesn't it?
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Without that account, We are bound to be in the loop of deception. The more
                                sophisticated the deception the more confused we become. But it is only the conscious
                                self that could be fooled. If you had trained your subconscious self to align with the
                                truth then it will find out long before you can figure that one out. Bringing that
                                knowledge to the conscious perception is all that is that I am trying to do.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Some triggers are hardwired into our body that would make us feel good or bad about
                                external stimuli. It is hardwired. It has got nothing to do with perception nor belief
                                or ideology. Think of it as the deepest layer of human existence that fears when they
                                see a threat, cuddles when they see a baby and eats when hungry. We needed these
                                reflexes to stay alive. The body doesn't care what you feel about yourself it will still
                                want to live even at the very last moment. The mechanisms in place gave rise to further
                                abstractions which helped us to conceal these things. But concealing is only necessary
                                for Tyranny. We are living in a democracy, As long as we are aligned with the truth and
                                want a win-win situation. We should be good.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                There will come circumstances when we meet people so different that we have to start
                                from the basics to understand the root but that root can never be touched if we are not
                                approachable in their eyes, to begin with. Let's do our part in our world to make it a
                                better place. That is the way we chose to repay for the life we live. Limiting ourselves
                                by holding self-limiting beliefs will only do more harm than good. In a world where
                                Spanish, Chinese, Indian, Latin Americans, kids, teenagers, adults, and elderly people
                                live in the same flat, speaking to only the people from our country of origin will only
                                limit our possibilities.
