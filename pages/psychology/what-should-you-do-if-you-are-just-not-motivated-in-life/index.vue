                            <p>
                                of this question. I was just surprised that I could
                                formulate this question.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Anyway! Let’s move on! I simply have a lot to say about a lot of things. I mostly do not
                                understand where all of this is coming from and all I know is it just keeps me going.
                                When I write I can forget about everything that is happening around me and just start
                                pouring my heart out into writing this blog or book or whatever!
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I can say I want to help you and help anyone trying to make it but the reality is that I
                                am also doing it for myself. Sometimes, I feel so heavy in my heart and all I can do or
                                want to do is just write for the next X hours. I do not know why it happens but all I
                                know is that it is probably because no one can tolerate me blabbering about philosophy
                                and psychology continuously for 8 hours and keep the conversation interesting all along.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I am sure it would be tiring for anyone trying to perform this endeavour. Probably
                                that’s the one thing that motivates me to just take the Ever Note and start writing
                                things. I do not know if this would become a blog or whatever, I just write it out. I do
                                not think about grammar or anything.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I am not even focused. I am just doing it. And half the time I do not know where all
                                this information is coming from. It feels like it is pouring out of my heart.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Motivation to do things is all about your environment, friends, family and the support
                                and the social ace they provide for your to achieve it according to me. I could be
                                wrong. But I don’t care if I am wrong. All I want to do is put a perspective out there
                                in front of you. I know for sure that it is either going to be what not to do or what
                                exactly to do! Either way, you have learnt something in life! And I am left happy as a
                                result because I was just useful to you.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                That is all I want to be right now at this moment! Useful, also probably heard! But not
                                as much because writing itself seems to be heard enough! Satisfactory enough! And there
                                are periods in which I stop writing because I feel satisfied with all the content that I
                                have put out there in the world.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Most of the time, I am embarrassed by the quality of the content I put out some years
                                ago! I still do not care! I just go ahead and something keeps me going.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It is also the lack of care I think that could help me keep going without hesitation.
                                Even though it is a monologue when you are reading this text it feels like a
                                conversation to me. I feel like we are having a conversation whenever I put content out.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                And this conversation is also enticing which is probably why I keep doing it over and
                                over again. That positive dopamine effect is what is called motivation right? A small
                                positive reinforcement is provided by our brain to just keep going and it says “good job
                                boy” “keep going” “it feels good!”
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It’s like taking drugs! I have no idea what taking drugs is like but people have said it
                                feels good!! I can tell you it feels really good to keep going. So I would say if you
                                ask me how to feel motivated when I want to achieve something and keep going inspired by
                                failure?
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Set a small goal for yourself. Something that you can achieve in like a day or two
                                without disrupting your other part of normal life and once you achieve it. If you truly
                                wanted to achieve it bad enough you will feel good. I promise you if you wanted it, you
                                will feel like you are at the top of the world!!
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                You would know deep down that you are doing the right thing to move towards your goal.
                                That is what I call motivation and positive reinforcement. Keep going and keep doing it.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Initially, I made a mistake, I have too much importance on these goals in life ignoring
                                what I already had! And although I felt that accomplishment I also felt like I was
                                losing something at the same time. If you feel that it simply means that you are
                                sacrificing something else too much and seek to balance it out or just talk with your
                                partner and kids to give you enough time to work on your goals so you don’t have to feel
                                guilty about using that time for yourself instead of spending too much feeling guilty,
                                talk and sort it out.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Figure out what is missing because of your new behaviour and try to strike that balance
                                it is always elusive but you will feel like you are getting closer.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Strive for little doses of dopamines in your life, something achievable and worth
                                striving for! It will help you keep motivated and going!!
