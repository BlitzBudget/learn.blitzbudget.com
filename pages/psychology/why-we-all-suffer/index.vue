                            <p>
                                that encompasses all our living beings. Bogged
                                down by the circumstances without which we could live freely without restrictions and
                                achieve what we had dreamed of achieving.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                In a sense, suffering gives us all a choice, to be resentful about our current situation
                                and declare an enemy who wants to keep us in that state or to be a dreamer and plan to
                                get to where we had always wanted to be. To dream is to see the possibilities. And to
                                see the possibilities is to see your potential. To see your potential is to be motivated
                                and with that motivation, you can finally take action towards achieving that dream.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                All of this gave birth buy suffering. In a sense suffering is something we should be
                                embracing. Embracing suffering with open arms with the full intention that that
                                suffering is only going to make us stronger every day and make us prepared for bigger
                                and better things which might await us in the future.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                That distant future will never come to us if we do not take action. Such is the power of
                                suffering. Which has the power to destroy using resentment or to have the power to
                                create using our potential to dream of a day when we would have everything that would
                                alleviate the suffering and even more Maybe, who knows what the future has in store for
                                us.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                And along the way to achieve, we may face hurdles which could seem far beyond our
                                capability to navigate through. But, never the less we still manage to bring out the
                                courage that resides within all of us and try to get closer to our goal.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Funny that suffering gives us clarity, goal, direction and meaning in life. We call all
                                see it is the people who have suffered and endured who are the most willing to help the
                                less fortunate. For we know that despite our efforts, hard work, endurance and
                                intelligence we would have reached nowhere if the opportunities has not presented
                                themselves almost before we had given up hope on ever achieving that goal.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                That could possibly be called luck, as the circumstances around which it would have been
                                possible for the world to have provided the opportunities are very minuscule.
                                Nevertheless, we shall all be given an opportunity but will never be capable of taking
                                them if we are not prepared for it.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                How many job openings do we have on LinkedIn at any given point in time for your role?
                                How many clients do you think you should approach before changing something in your
                                product or the way you approach them? There are possibly 7.7 billion possibilities if we
                                focus on transacting with the people. Most of the time people don’t know what they want.
                                What is going to do about it? Where is the market moving towards now? What is the market
                                moving away from? Where are you situated there?
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                All of the questions would definitely give us more clarity about where we are. Upon
                                knowing where we are we often are disappointed with the place where we are at, present
                                and it is that which gives us the possibility to see where we want to go and navigate
                                towards it.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                When I was learning to drive, I soon learnt that if we need to avoid hitting a tree. It
                                is futile to look at the tree and try to stay on the road. Because you will soon realize
                                that you would hit the trunk of the tree, the one thing that you intend to avoid.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                No matter the intention, where you see is where you go. All the while if you are
                                bitching about the current circumstances and exactly how unjust that situation is and as
                                a result, curse all those that you think are responsible for it and hate them. That is
                                inevitably what we all start to propagate, and as a result, hate and resentment. That
                                would soon be the way we start seeing the world. And the more we hate, the more we
                                unconsciously move away from our goal. The more we start to hate and resent. This
                                becomes a cycle that would never lead us to where we initially wanted to go.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                If we cannot reliably iterate a habit, 10, 100, or 1000 times and reach a place which is
                                far better than where are currently then that habit is detrimental to our emotional and
                                spiritual well-being. Start moving away from that habit.
                                <br>

                                I would feel less confident about my body when I initially came to Spain and started to
                                see all the people my age living in Madrid who were extremely fit and energetic. That
                                kind of kept me lowballing every time around, and I kept beating myself up for a long
                                time. I blamed the bad food culture that I was exposed to in India, and I blamed the bad
                                food culture that I was exposed to in the UK
                                when I was doing my masters. But the one thing that did not change is that I was looking
                                for some other external circumstances which had forced me to be the way I am right now,
                                instead of focusing on what I had to do to reach where I wanted to reach. At least a
                                person who could wear a T-shirt for once without trying to loosen the belly area or
                                having to be conscious about it every now and then.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It is only recently that I started working on it really intensely and started losing
                                around 5 KG, I kind of make it seem too easy. But trust me it is not, we had to change
                                the whole circumstances, start getting used to intermittent fasting, destroy my
                                prejudice and self-confidence that I could somehow become fit without exercise, and
                                educate the people around me about exactly what is it that I am trying to achieve and
                                how much it really means to me.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Even after all this, when we start to feel hungry or smell or even see food, my
                                subconscious goes “have it right now”. Then I had to create an eating window within
                                which I am allowed to eat and the rest of the time when I am not allowed to eat. That
                                kind of liberated me from this responsibility of when is it that I am actually allowed
                                to eat and when is it that I am not allowed to eat. And how to time it precisely to
                                ensure that I lose weight every day. How much of the food should I actually eat??
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Depending on how your parents have raised you and thought you around well, you will have
                                it either easier or harder to make these new habits by destroying the old ones.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It is definitely harder than it seems. Some people have to tell their parents who
                                eventually teach and train their kids to be healthier naturally so by just changing one
                                or two habits you can fix your issues. But other like us have at least one parent who
                                was obese and thought us some bad habits that are detrimental to our health so it means
                                that we are required to change 5 - 10 habits at a time to have any reasonable effect on
                                our body.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                That is one of those moments when we can either choose to hate our parents for providing
                                us with those subconscious bad habits or understand and appreciate all the other good
                                things that they ingrained in us when we were a child which helps us to this day and
                                some of them do not have.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Suffering this has the potential opportunity to let you be grateful for the things that
                                you have but others around you don’t. That liberates you from self-pity, self resentment
                                and self-deceit. Why did I put self-deceit there? Some people say my parents, my
                                grandparents and my great-grandparents have this chronic obesity and hence I am a
                                chronically obese person. It’s just an example. Maybe there is someone who thinks about
                                this, maybe it is true but genes also have the potential to change. More genes in our
                                body have the potential to change with our habits and lifestyle than the ones that are
                                passed down to you generationally.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                And your choice to live a better life and shape your genes to be a little healthier will
                                force your future kids to have a healthier genes. Just a little bit better.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Such is the power of good habits and healthy thinking. Always see the light even during
                                the darkest of times it will get you to a better place and be a little more grateful
                                about life.
