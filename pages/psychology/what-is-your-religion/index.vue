              <h3 class="title">The need for religion and god...</h3>
              <p>
                is intrinsic in most people. Once the god is destroyed then we
                are in chaos.
                <br />
                <br />
                After killing the highest god (self-transformation to become the
                highest good) then the lower gods like Politics, nationalists,
                fascists, communists, and other ideological beliefs take over
                our minds and are converted into belief.
                <br />
                <br />
                There is a need for meaning in life that has to be found. Most
                people also identify them as a new age ideology which could be a
                belief system of the ideologies.
                <br />
                <br />
                If you have too many choices in life then it becomes chaos
                itself but if you have too less then it becomes suffocating,
                which is why people make choices that restrict them in a
                meaningful way.
                <br />
                <br />
                If you do not live by a rule then everything can descend into
                chaos.
                <br />
                <br />
                It is our choice to start fighting with ideologies and then
                choose the best one that incorporates the best of all the
                ideologies and create a new god which unites everyone under that
                one umbrella. We know now that That god has not been assembled
                yet.
                <br />
                <br />
                Religion is not just dogma and constraining. It served as a
                community, it was soul fulfilling in some manner. We feel more
                meaningful if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves.
                <br />
                <br />
                Religion provides a moral code by which to conduct people's
                lives. We see that morality is thrown out of the window by
                certain sects of the population and the only thing that holds
                them from doing something bad is the Law.
                <br />
                <br />
                If you say that I do not belong to any ideology. Then life
                becomes meaningless. And then a sect forms around that which is
                a group of people living meaningless lives.
                <br />
                <br />
                I do not suggest that is all people are once they adopt an
                ideology but once you convince yourself that you are a communist
                or a capitalist then the choices that you make in life will be
                influenced by those ideologies.
                <br />
                <br />
                Then we can see it play through people's lives and derive an
                explanation as to which it was meaningful to suffer because they
                chose that ideology.
                <br />
                <br />
                Pick your poison, man! We all will suffer! We just get to choose
                what it is that we are suffering from!
                <br />
                <br />
                I still do not think going back to religion and dogma and
                drinking cow urine (yea! I was freaking shocked as well, people
                do sell this shit and India) is the right way to go about in
                life.
                <br />
                <br />
                I think religion died for good, it had to! Our ancestors killed
                god and now we are killing religion, I still think it is the
                right way to go about it.
                <br />
                <br />
                We just have to be a bit more careful as to what to choose
                instead of choosing religion or god! You are choosing something.
                <br />
                <br />
                I loved things, that then evolved into materialistic ideology
                then it was easy to become a capitalist which automatically made
                me an anti-communist. Then I married a communist! Life! I know!
                <br />
                <br />
                Now I see the advantage of a communist government in a democracy
                with a capitalistic economy.
                <br />
                <br />
                Well, see what is happening in the US and India. What is missing
                is communism. The environmentalists are probably becoming
                apocalyptic and think humans should not inhibit the plant at
                all! That just makes everything that we have ever accomplished a
                grand mistake.

              <p>
                Life is more meaningful when we are intermingled.
                <br />
                The ethical principles and morality are thrown out of the window
                when we choose capitalism as such selling something bad to
                someone are bad but if you throw away the morality then you can
                sell anyone anything and feel good thinking that you are doing
                what you do because you do not earn enough. When you have more
                money you will stop doing it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Well, cheating was a bad thing until we killed god and destroyed
                religion. Now it is a commonality among poor people to have been
                married or been with multiple partners with kids from multiple
                partners. That’s a receipt for disaster!
              </p>
              <p>
                And you ask the parents what do they want for their kids, they
                would say marry a rich man! Ha! But that’s not what you did!
              </p>
              <p>
                Take alcoholism for example, according to Jordan Peterson,
                connecting people back to religion is a definitive way of making
                the alcoholic stop drinking alcohol and never touch it again
                ever!
              </p>
              <p>
                People are spiritual but that does not mean that we need to be
                religious connecting morality to religion and throwing morality
                out is throwing the baby with the bathwater.
              </p>
              <p>Take the good, and ignore the bad, repeat, until you die!</p>
