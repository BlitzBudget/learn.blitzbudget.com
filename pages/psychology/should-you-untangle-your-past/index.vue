                            <p>
                                relationships and how is this relevant in any way to
                                success or the goal towards which I a moving?
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Like it or not, we are all constrained by our past and how we see ourselves through the
                                mirror of our past.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                No matter what you have done in your past, however horrible it may have been, you
                                deserve to a second chance if you repent ( for a lack of a better term).
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I do not mean go to the church and repent for your sins. Haha! That would be so easy,
                                right? Kill someone and go to the church and say you are sorry and the father says you
                                are forgiven. And everything is bliss from then on. (I am just imaging all of this BTW,
                                Never repented before)
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Life doesn’t work like that. You have to understand that the first step to being able to
                                look forward in life and aim high is to remove the shackles of the past and be set free.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                What do I mean by that? I mean analyze for god sake the things that you have done in
                                your past that do not make sense to you and then figure it out. If you can not do it on
                                your own. Share it with a lot of people. Get a good therapist and try to untangle your
                                past.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Something whatever it is that happened to you could be so complicated that you need to
                                untangle it one at a time and speak with a lot of people to understand how it happened
                                and exactly why it happened.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It could have just been the stupid stuff that you did to others or that something
                                terrible has happened to you and now and then your mind reminds you that this terrible
                                has happened which is preventing you to move on.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I remember my wife speaking a lot about her past. When I first met it is almost always
                                what she talked about. At first, I thought it was just her trying to describe everything
                                that has ever happened to her.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I just had to understand her a bit more and it helped me understand her more when she
                                shared a lot of her past.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                After a while, I noticed a pattern. She started sharing certain parts of her past now
                                and then. We talked about it a lot whenever it came up. I just felt like she had to go
                                through a lot of sheer bull shit just to reach where she had reached.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                And that she did not deserve to be treated like that in the past. Unfortunately, every
                                single human being had to go through it. I don’t know why! That’s just how life seems to
                                be.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                So the more we untangle the less she started to talk about them. But after a few years,
                                I noticed a pattern. She talked frequently about a few selective stories over and over
                                again.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It could have been once every 4 months right? I didn’t understand then why that was
                                happening and I used to tell her that yea you had mentioned it before to me. Sometimes
                                she shuts up but in other instances, she goes on!
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                This goes on for years right. We both just think we are talking about stupid stuff. And
                                then I get introduced to Jordan Peterson, I kind of got drawn into him because he
                                explained so clearly why is it that a lot of things that are going on in our society are
                                just pure bull shit.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I leave my side project, write my blogs and just start consuming him and absorbing his
                                ideology. I guess that is where the words repent comes from. Anyway, after about a year
                                and half of that shit. I start to use understand the world and the people who make up
                                our world just a little bit more.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I understood that it may just be worth it to have a kid. It may just be worth it to live
                                responsibly and try to contribute and be responsible to the environment and society. The
                                one major take away man! I was able to integrate the emotional part of myself into
                                myself.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                So after all this, we start to u tangle a lot of her past. Now it has been over 10 years
                                together and noticed that she talks about something that happened to her like 13 years
                                ago and describes it in such detail. We talk about it for hours and hours and finally,
                                we were able to completely untangle the past experiences that she had gone through.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                She had to verify a lot of things that had happened to her with a lot of people to
                                confirm the details but she understood what happened and why it happened and finally
                                realized truly absorbed and integrated the experience of that past.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I tell you, man, it changes you. It changes the way you see life from then on. And then
                                you can truly move on with your life.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It’s not like you don’t move on if you do not understand life right? You do move on. Why
                                not just have some things in life that you don’t want to understand and just get on with
                                it.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Well, as Jordan Peterson says, the brain just reminds you every and then that something
                                had happened. And if that event had happened more than one and half years ago. It
                                probably has to be untangled for you to truly move on from that experience.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I believe in that statement! Truly and wholeheartedly. I have seen the changes in
                                untangling of our past experiences in life and it has truly changed our lives. For
                                better or worse it has changed our lives.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The fact is we will never truly know if it was for the better or worse until it is too
                                late.
