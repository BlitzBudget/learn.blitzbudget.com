                            <h3 class="title">Video games!! They were an integral part of my life since childhood.</h3>
                            <p>
                                I started playing games in the era of Prince of Persia. How many of you guys have played it?
                                I used to play it a lot. Actually, I played a lot of games, like Dangerous Dave, Contra,
                                Shooting duck, Unreal Tournament, and Resident Evil on PS2. When I promised my mom that I
                                would get first place during my 11th and 12th grades, I had strong motivation to prevent my
                                mom from going through such hardship to get me into a school.
                                <br><br>
                                I messed up my chance to stay in the same school during my 10th grade. They had an exam at
                                the end of the 10th grade, and I just hated staying in the hostel so much that I lied and
                                went to my parent's place in Indore, Maharashtra from Chennai.
                                <br><br>
                                I hated, with a capital H, my stay in the hostel. People had this tyrannical hierarchy, they
                                would bully me, sideline me, and create gangs that I was never a part of. The truth is that
                                I could not resonate with them. Their thought process was so different from mine that we
                                were never going to be a group.
                                <br><br>
                                I was so naive. They seemed to have incorporated darkness. They were capable of inflicting
                                deliberate harm when possible to others and never shied away from it when necessary.
                                <br><br>
                                So I missed this opportunity to stay essentially in the same school and went through a
                                horrible experience. I was pretty average in my 10th grade due to the emotional stress of
                                staying in the hostel. I know it is an excuse, but I was like 15 years old and that was all
                                I could handle.
                                <br><br>
                                So I was essentially kicked out of that school and had to join or apply as a new student.
                                All I asked my parents was that one of them would have to come and stay with me during my
                                11th and 12th grades in Chennai, and whichever school I went to, I would ensure that I
                                become first in the class if they could provide me with that privilege.
                                <br><br>
                                I essentially did that with persistence, and as a reward, I asked my grandfather for a
                                PlayStation 2, and he got me one. Before joining my bachelor's, I had this 6-month gap and
                                all I ever did was play from morning to night.
                                <br><br>
                                I mean play video games, from then on I kind of attached my identity to being a person who
                                plays video games. Even when I joined college, I convinced myself that earning 70% marks is
                                sufficient and what is more important is balance in life. But that also included me playing
                                2-3 hours of DOTA every day for the next 4 years.
                                <br><br>
                                I say this because I was a person who was proud of playing games and attached my identity to
                                it. Life happened, I went to the UK and found myself a poor person, back to 0. Like Ray
                                Dalio says, revolution is a great leveler. I really felt that everything was removed and I
                                was thrown into a new system where all my Indian peers, including myself, were at level 0.
                                <br><br>
                                God, I was extremely miserable. Saying "extremely miserable" does not accurately describe my
                                feelings. I was pretty devastated. From then on, my motivation was to get back to that
                                middle-class comfortable standard that I am currently in after 10 years of effort from the
                                UK back in 2013.
                                <br><br>
                                It feels so far apart, like more than 10 years' worth of gap. When I think back, it feels
                                like more than 10 years, you know what I mean?
                                <br><br>
                                During these 10 years, I have always felt that playing games was a luxury. Like taking a
                                rest and a break from real life. I can enter this virtual universe where I enjoy the
                                progress and rewards that I couldn't get in the real world. It felt good actually to keep
                                staying in that virtual world.
                                <br><br>
                                Sometimes it was my attraction towards zombie movies that made me start playing some zombie
                                apocalypse games. Or it could be that I had so much free time that I would just listen to an
                                audiobook and play Age of Empires for like 8 months whenever I had some free time when I
                                first came to Spain. I had to spend 8 months without my wife alone in Spain where no one
                                speaks English, at least not the people whom I knew anyway.
                                <br><br>
                                Slowly, I started feeling guilty when I played games. It felt like whenever I played, I
                                wasn't living my real life, and I noticed that it made my eyesight a little worse.
                                <br><br>
                                I had been wearing glasses since my 11th and 12th grades when all I did was study, and I
                                didn't even bother turning on the lights when it got dark, so I developed myopia.
                                <br><br>
                                After reading so many scientific papers on the 27th of March 2017, I just decided to stop
                                wearing glasses and live a life without searching for them as soon as I woke up.
                                <br><br>
                                I felt so dependent and low as a result of being dependent on something. It affected my
                                self-confidence so much.
                                <br><br>
                                When I played video games, I noticed that it made my eyesight worse and I would get
                                headaches. Plus, that was time I was not spending with my wife and not living a life worth
                                living. It felt like video games were taking so much away from me.
                                <br><br>
                                So, this year in 2022, like every year, I made a promise that I would not play video games
                                for a whole year. After feeling miserable after a month of playing games, I thought I could
                                just use my willpower to not play. I had done that previously and it worked successfully in
                                the past.
                                <br><br>
                                The one thing, however, I didn't take into account was the fact that I had been consuming
                                too much Jordan Peterson content, which fundamentally changed me into a person who was more
                                open to life and the possibility of being vulnerable. I was more vulnerable! As a result,
                                even now, I believe vulnerability is the single greatest change Jordan Peterson can give
                                you, including meaning and purpose in life, if you start believing in morality. All the more
                                good.
                                <br><br>
                                I kind of deeply became all of that. I rediscovered my morality, which I had somehow lost in
                                the pursuit of money. Having lived in Spain, I thought living morally was not an option in
                                western nations.
                                <br><br>
                                I was seeing too many Hollywood movies, apparently, and I wanted to become a westerner as
                                well. Little did I know that I had lost the key to living the most fulfilling life. A life
                                worth living is worth living morally.
                                <br><br>
                                By morality, I mean reflecting and being empathetic towards others, understanding that what
                                affects you can be used in reverse to inflict pain on others. That knowledge changed me.
                                <br><br>
                                I was a different person, and somehow my willpower was just not enough to keep me in check
                                from playing video games.
                                <br><br>
                                It lasted for like 4 months, and after writing like 35 articles for this book, I felt so
                                empty that I started playing video games again. It was then that I noticed a pattern.
                                <br><br>
                                When I feel empty and exhausted, I use playing video games as an escape to refill or at
                                least not feel exhausted anymore.
                                <br><br>
                                After understanding this fundamental reason, which subconsciously triggers me to move
                                towards playing video games, the next time I felt that way, I stopped the creation spree
                                that I was in and spent more time with my loving wife, watching a movie or going out for a
                                drink, and the next day, I could get back to it.
                                <br><br>
                                I know more successful people do not have the luxury of taking a whole day off. But heck, I
                                am young and always feel like I need to nurture my relationship. I think everyone should
                                spend quality time nurturing all the people who love them unconditionally. I do not mean the
                                relationships that fall into the "frenemy" category, as Vanessa Van Edwards put it. By the
                                way, look into her work.
                                <br><br>
                                It's amazing the kind of things that you can learn from her books. She adds so much value
                                and helps us understand so much more about human behavior that I cannot insist enough. Go
                                and read her books.
                                <br><br>
                                Coming back to the point, the new resolution did not work for me, and I guess it does not
                                work as well as it could for you either. Simply saying that you will not do something does
                                not suffice.
                                <br><br>
                                You have to understand the subconscious impulses that trigger you to move towards playing
                                video games or whatever it is that you do not want to do, and then ask yourself what other
                                constructive and meaningful things you can replace them with.
                                <br><br>
                                That approach only works for resolutions where you do not want to engage in negative
                                behaviors. But what if you want to do something?
