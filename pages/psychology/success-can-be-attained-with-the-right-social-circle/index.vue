                            <p>
                                where we feel like a lot of other people around us are
                                wealthy. There are 8 billion people in the world now and nearly 3 billion people are
                                from India and China alone.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                And all over the world even among the developed nations. The elite population is the
                                minority. Now don’t blame capitalism for it !! Unless you think North Korea's people are
                                more wealthy or the indigenous population around the world is more wealthy.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Frankly, they are not! And largely the poverty levels are getting abolished. And there
                                is only relative poverty. So! Having cleared that up! We all have our surroundings and
                                our friends and for the most part, we do not choose them, the life has already chosen
                                them for us in a certain sense because of the place you were born and the parents you
                                had at least up until your childhood ends, nothing was under your control.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The brain only fully develops in our 20’s. So we can start to live our lives fully after
                                that. We realize that other things in life are worth striving for and we try to get
                                them.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                We often find it out of reach altogether and are left to wonder are truly
                                underprivileged that we have almost no chance of attaining them? And the reality hits us
                                or so it would seem.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The same happened to me a lot of times during my teens when I saw a lot of people
                                flaunting money around and I had comparatively less money than my friends. It is only in
                                my 30s that I understood that I was among the 30% of the privileged population in India
                                who has had a really good education and the opportunity to be truly anyone whom I wanted
                                to be.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Let’s face it, man! If we had it easy in our childhood and our parents had not taken
                                care of us or put us in a bad school we would probably have had to start further back
                                than we had to!! And many people find themselves in exactly that situation only in
                                comparison to other people who are doing far better than them.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                That hits us, man! Seriously!! It almost destroys our soul to see so much money around
                                us flaunting but never in our reach.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                No wonder a lot of people choose to seem rich rather than choosing to be wealthy. No one
                                ever got wealthy buying Gucci bags with their savings.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                When you have your friends buying Gucci bags and flaunting them in front of you. It
                                would seem that just to be around them and feel equally worth being around such a friend
                                group you would also need to be rich. As in, but a Gucci.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                That might satisfy our ego but what we do not know yet is, that it is the cycle that is
                                going to destroy us and keep us poor. Seeming to be rich and living to Jones.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                There is also this other type of people who say tradition is everything and seem to
                                stick around their culture even when they make little to no sense of why they are doing
                                what they are doing.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                All of this is to ensure that the social circle that we are currently in, is equally
                                accepting of us. That need for acceptance would make us do stupid things which we would
                                otherwise not do in our lives.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It is also the one that equally keeps us from getting where we want to go and achieving
                                what we want to achieve.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I see people wasting so much of their time just gaming when they are in their 20’s and
                                30’s and building a hierarchy in the gaming world and truth be told they just need to
                                feel belonged and they feel like the real world is less forgiving than the game world in
                                which they feel much more belonged and they are thriving.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                But is that all good? As long as you feel belonged is nothing else more deserving ??
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                We beg to defer, the same social circle that makes you feel belonged in the same circle
                                keeping you there and preventing you from reaching where you want to reach.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                People call it comfort zone, some others call it laziness but in reality let’s face it!
                                It cannot be described in a single word. It is a sense of belonging, a fear of the
                                unknown outside this known circle, a desire to want what others have but the refusal to
                                leave the circle.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Some of them might have the privilege to have both of them. But most just don’t, I am
                                addressing those people who cannot have both of them. Try to maintain that circle and
                                slowly venture into the unknown as a part-time and see if you like it. It could be one
                                hour a day or two hours. Try to work towards your goal from where you are.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Maybe you can have both or all of what you want. I truly believe you have bought the
                                cake and have it too!! I do not understand who came up with the phrase. In today's
                                world, we can have everything we can!
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                We are destroying everything to ensure that we survive, we might as well live good, live
                                happily and then after we have reached where we wanted to then start living responsibly.
                                All along the way try to help someone who is not as fortunate as you are.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It is truly souls fulfilling. And more often you will find out that once you try to
                                venture into the unknown it is the same circle that will pull you down and keep you in
                                it and criticize you for trying something out of the ordinary.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                If your soul truly feels empty then do whatever is necessary to keep venturing into the
                                unknown world one step at a time towards your goal. It could be a step in the opposite
                                direction but as long as you think it is the step towards the right goal do it. You will
                                learn along the way and correct the course and eventually reach there.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                When I got fired from the UK in Hygiene Solutions. My soul told me to go back to India.
                                The primary reason we came to the UK is to run away from India and go to a developed
                                nation. It is truly what I wanted.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                But after working in the UK I felt like I did it belong there no one wanted me there and
                                the government was against me and made it hard for me to stay there back in 2013. There
                                was no Post Study Work visa and everyone wanted someone who has had at least 2 years of
                                work experience and I was a graduate.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I needed to have at least 24,000 Pounds back then minimum to be eligible to get a work
                                visa. Honestly, who is going to pay that much for a graduate??
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                So the most reasonable thing for me to do after getting fired from the Gradúate Software
                                Engineer job I had finally got after months of relentless job search was to just accept
                                defeat and go back to India.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It was like taking 10 steps back at that time. Then I got a job as an intern in India
                                without pay for the first 5 months. But I took it. I thought the opportunity was enough.
                                Then just after a year, the company that I was working for had to close because of a
                                lack of projects. And as luck would have there was an opportunity in Spain around that
                                time and here I am in Europe as a result.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Who would have thought that my going to India was a step in the right direction? It
                                seemed like it is not but my soul told me to just go back and start there. So I did, I
                                felt so low doing it but I knew I had to do what I had to do!
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Now I am in a much better place than I had ever imagined in the wildest of my dreams!
                                Here I am thinking this is not enough and I need more!! Ha!!
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The soul just craves the excitement of the journey. We would just have to keep moving.
