                            <p>
                                and that required our lives to be
                                organized in such a way that it had never been required ever before.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                When I was a kid, I knew that we had to have breakfast at 8:00, lunch at 12:00 and
                                dinner at 20:00 and then to bed at 22:00 and wake up again at 6:30 the next day.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It was practically my routine for years. In between, I would have 18:00 - 20:00 to study
                                and that was dedicated study time.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                All of this kind of was hectic and that was probably why I hated the routines for a very
                                long time since I was 18 years of age. And had never been accustomed to a routine ever
                                since. My only routine was eating when I feel like it, and sleeping when I feel like it
                                for well over 13 years. That had worked for me really good.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Or so I thought, initially it was so liberating that I would literally play video games
                                or roam out of my home until 04:00 in the morning with my friends and then go back to
                                bed.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                These things were fun given the age back then. It probably can be today if I was being
                                restricted by someone else from doing what I really wanted to do for a very long time.
                                Anyway, now that we are doing this strict regime which has a concrete 3 - 4 hours window
                                within which we have to eat and a window within which we have to go to bed and a window
                                within which we have to exercise to ensure we are burning fat when we are exercising. It
                                is kind of liberating in the 30s as there are so many more things to worry about and so
                                many more responsibilities to handle every single time thinking about when to cook what
                                and how much quantity to eat and how slow to eat them to enjoy the food the best for 2 -
                                3 times a day and then deciding on going to bed, communicating that with my wife is a
                                lot of cognitive power wasted.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                That cognition would rather be used instead on other things that would require much
                                thought like focusing on writing this blog or focusing on my job, listening to podcasts
                                and million other things that require equal attention at this time. That’s it in a
                                nutshell. Just for this reason alone, we can start doing routines and keep the day
                                simple and automated. I also noticed that having a good routine makes me more energetic,
                                I do not take a mid-day nap, I sleep for 8 hours and wake up naturally instead of
                                sleeping for 10 hours and waking up tired. I wasn’t able to breathe properly as well due
                                to COVID my breathing pattern became shallow not because I got COVID but because of
                                wearing masks. And as a result, I started having sleep apnea. I would wake up multiple
                                times without being able to take a breath.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I think that was also because I was a little overweight and was not exercising. So I
                                have been working on that to make that a routine. These were not the things that I
                                thought I had to encounter in my 30s. Also started having knee pain when walking 10 km
                                on my right knee. Yoga solves that for me.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                So every morning shortly after I wake up, I start doing yoga initially which now also
                                has exercise incorporated into it. Followed by a cold shower. It is summer now, let’s
                                see when winter comes. I have to have a relatively cold shower.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                That’s not the problem now I guess. These are kind of automated now, and that frees up
                                the cognition but freeing up the resources does not however automatically mean that it
                                would naturally be focused towards your betterment.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It depends on how you had trained your subconscious and how you react to those
                                subconscious stimuli. If you had trained it really well and lived in a place and time
                                where you can physically take care of yourself, where your loved ones surround you with
                                sufficient income to not worry about the immediate future. Then you would be in a calm
                                state which has the potential to enable you to keep improving yourself to ensure that
                                you can keep providing these resources to yourself and to your loved ones.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                These are important problems to solve I guess but not as important as physical health,
                                having someone to love or not having enough money.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Even though money does not bring eternal happiness, it does prevent you from being
                                unhappy. Took those words from Tom Bilyeu's show.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I find that statement to be entirely true. Literally, all of us adults spend 8 hours or
                                more pursuing money or aiding our partner to enable him or her to earn more money by
                                taking care of the household.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                What if you are in a position where you find yourself in such a deep dark pit that you
                                couldn’t even find a spark of light towards which you could potentially go. I can only
                                assume that life is horrendously hard for you and I can never truly understand how it is
                                to be in that position where you are right now but you know, which is exactly why you
                                are being tormented by these thoughts. Use them! Use them well! Mould yourself to become
                                a much better person by learning from these mistakes what else could you do?
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Even Viktor Franklyn the author of Man in search for meaning said that the people who
                                died in the nazi camp were the ones who had truly lost meaning and purpose in life and
                                you would know that they would die in the next 48 - 72 hours. That’s the core essence of
                                our life, without which we cannot even hope to keep ourselves alive. If Viktor Franklyn
                                can find deep meaning when all that he was doing is shovelling rocks most of the time
                                pointlessly and having only a piece of bread to eat all day. I am sure you can find
                                meaning in your life something that you still have and the ones that you cherish.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                like the time when Luffy was consumed by grief when fire fist ace died and Jimbei
                                managed to pull him out of that deep slumber by asking him what he still had that he
                                cherishes still?
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                No matter how you feel today tomorrow is going to be a little better if you cannot see
                                something as outlandish as 2 - 5 years from now. Start working towards looking forward
                                to a tomorrow and make some very very small plans to move towards being a better human
                                being and a stronger personality so you would never have to feel like that ever again.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Gather some really really close friends or family in the future who can share and absorb
                                your pain, that makes it really easy. And the move towards being better is what you have
                                to focus on and turn into a routine. That would definitely help you and make you a
                                better person. That process would definitely make you a better human being.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Routine is what makes us humans! Let us all conjure the power of routines and strive to
                                become a better version of ourselves tomorrow by working towards minimal improvements
                                today.
