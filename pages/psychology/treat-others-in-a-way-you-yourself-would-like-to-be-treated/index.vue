                                one way we would decide how society is structured.
                                Imagine a society where no one trusts no one and the next opportunity that you would get
                                you to betray someone if they are strangers to obtain something in life.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                There would be an imminent mistrust rampant in the society and that would just have a
                                rippling effect on the conscience of the people living in such a society. Nobody would
                                trust anybody. This is exactly what happened in Stalin's Russia when moles were planted
                                in almost every family and you would be rewarded if you find someone doing something
                                which would anger the Stalin's government. And such a person would be put in a labour
                                camp. The book "Gulag Archipelago" describes the conditions of the labour camp pretty
                                precisely what to expect.

                                Someone has to work to ensure that the communist Russia lives and it was largely the
                                labour camps it seems that there were also people who ensured that the slaves carry 50
                                kilos of sand on their shoulders pointlessly for hours. Some say that the book ensured
                                that the communist ideology propagation to the west ended because of the book.

                                Our past almost always clings on to us never letting us move away from it, no matter how
                                much we suffer for it and it is under those circumstances that one has to learn to
                                forgive oneself and also forget. If you do not forgive yourself, you would just be a
                                miserable soul passing on to the next one or whomever it is that is willing to listen to
                                you.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Building a beautiful trustworthy society where we are willing to trust a stranger is one
                                step in the right direction and it can only be achieved if we learn to treat others in a
                                way we would like to be treated. There is just no other way to move forward with life.
                                The prism through which you see life is also the prism through which others see you as.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It constrains you and shows you as a person who sees people in a certain way. Does not
                                in any way constrain others, it might make them feel bad for a while. The way you look
                                at the effects the way they look at you.
                                <br>

                                If you reduce a complex personality into an old fool or a stupid person. Then, It is we
                                who see them who tend to lose and not the other way around. Almost always they have a
                                valuable lesson to teach us. "What to do" or "What not to do". Both are equally valuable
                                as you do not have to go and do it yourself to learn the valuable lesson.
                                <br>

                                Everyone is at some stage in their life and they have a much better social circle you
                                could just have one friend but you might be successful monetarily while they are not
                                that well off. Every single thing that makes us feel complete is a treasure worth
                                protecting. It could be a single "How are you doing today with a smile" which could be
                                enough for a person hearing it to bring back the lost faith in humanity.
                                <br>

                                A society that justifies having a weapon like the US is predominantly a society that
                                does not trust and thinks that every single individual needs to be protected from
                                something. Such a weapon can also be used to inflict harm. Like how we are seeing things
                                happening all around the US. The solution that the US employs seems to be more of an
                                authoritarian state rather than a democracy. It is worth moving towards authoritarianism
                                for something as silly as the "Right to carry arms".
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Is it ok for the cops to start killing their citizens just because they allow people to
                                carry arms? How many unnecessary deaths have we had to see before realizing that it is
                                just too steep a price to pay. Distrust in the economy and a general trust that anyone
                                can carry arms so everyone can be killed if I am protecting myself.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Self-defence is a primitive mechanism at play. Its primary trigger is threat and fear
                                that you might attack them. If anything can attack me from anywhere and I have an
                                automatic rifle. I am going to shoot something that I do not want to at some point in
                                time. Or someone is going to do it.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I know I am the same person who told that to start changing myself first and who is now
                                bitching about other countries where India has its own problems to deal with. But you
                                know what, What seems to affect the US seems to affect the rest of the world and what
                                seems to affect India just affects India and its irrelevant neighbours.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                What seems to affect china also affects the whole world. So in today's, political play
                                India is nothing compared to Europe, the US, China and finally Russia which is
                                self-destructing itself as we speak.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I would just start with listening more. That has the effect of fundamentally changing
                                people. When you just listen more people start saying I had a good time with that
                                person. They don't even know that you spent 20% of the time talking while they spent 80%
                                of the time talking. Of course, there are different types of personalities and it
                                changes depending on people to people. But everyone wants to be heard. I know that
                                because that is fundamentally the reason I am writing. I want to be heard.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                And writing or talking helps people sort out the mess in their heads and understand
                                themselves much better. I first started writing because I felt a heaviness in my heart
                                and writing kind of cured it. And the process of writing the first book changed me
                                fundamentally into a more complete person. Although the book was only sold a few hundred
                                times in the past 4 years I am happy that I spent one and half years writing it. It
                                changed me from the core. And I hope reading changes you as well. Since I am a happy
                                person, I can treat others with the respect they deserve.

                                <br>
                                If you dislike someone, Just ignore them but don't treat them bad. There are 8 billion
                                people on the planet to fuzz about that one person who mistreated you. Honestly, not
                                worth it!
