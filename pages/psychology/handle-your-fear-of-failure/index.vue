                            <p>
                                of the current generation. We see Instagram and Facebook where people have a perfect life
                                and we are forced to move towards that perfect or we feel shitty about our current.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Feeling shitty about our current place is a good thing. Just don’t have self-defeating
                                thoughts about it saying “well, I am never going to reach that place anyway”.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It just beats the whole point right? What if I told you that you could channel the energy to
                                do what you wanted to do about it ??
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I was a bit shy about showing my body to anybody as I thought it was not perfect, I was
                                sitting on that emotion for a very long time like 5 years before even starting to exercise a
                                few months ago. I am already feeling good about it.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                So who am I to talk about it when I don’t follow my advice right?? Haha!! Well, surprise,
                                surprise people fail all the time in life! I think you and I can learn from my failure.
                                People consume too much content. So I know that I am trying my best to push you in the right
                                direction to achieve what you wanted to achieve and that is all that matters now!
                                INTENTION!!
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                We can all have good intentions and do nothing about it! Well, this is me trying to do
                                something about it in my way! What is my motivation to help you? It just makes me feel good
                                and helps promote my website and hopefully, I am moving you one step closer to buying my
                                products.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Evil Capitalist trying to sell a product while lecturing right! Let’s face it, man! We
                                wouldn’t be here without capitalism and the fact that we are all surviving means we
                                participate in it and the honestly capitalistic economy is here to stay! So why not help
                                people and just along the way make some money?
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                If I feel any self-defeating thought, I write it down and define it. And I think the truth
                                will set me free. And now that is out of the way!
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Let’s move on! If I think I might fail and all of this might be a bit too embarrassing for
                                me to read and what if someone that I know reads what I write and laughs about it! I will
                                not do it, man!
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Who cares, no one cares about this blog as much as I do anyway! So why not get this out of
                                the way. It just blocks me from writing the next one and creating a new blog that might just
                                help another person while I am trying to build myself as a good human being.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Fearing failure would have just made me watch Netflix and One Piece all day without doing
                                anything. It is just a pointless existence.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I used to do it until 2018 myself and one day my wife tells me you know what there is this
                                guy in my office who loves programming and he just keeps on going with his project during
                                the offline time and comes back to work and starts with work and back to home and restart
                                his side hustle. It blew my mind that someone could be that motivated to just keep
                                programming.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                You would have to be in love with it, man! If not, it is just hard to do that! I took that
                                motivation, I didn’t think I cannot ever do it! I could never be that person! I can never be
                                that person because if so blah blah blah will happen.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I thought, how could I be that person retaining everything that I have right now and keep
                                learning during my free time. It was my only motivation to start BlitzBudget. I already had
                                an idea for over a year. Was just sitting on it without taking action.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I was just lazy, right? Everyone! Everyone said what you do is just not feasible and almost
                                everyone else ignored what I did! Still do most of the time. It is just silent rejection,
                                right? Ignoring you!
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Despite all that, we should just keep going! Been on it for like 5 years and still couldn’t
                                monetize the app nor create a mobile application. Talk about failure, man!
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                There was this time when I was creating this application that I felt like it is just
                                impossible to keep going I quit creating the web application left it halfway and never
                                touched it for the next one and a half years from Mid 2020 to 2022.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I just quit, man! It was self-defeat on a different scale. I kind of convinced myself that I
                                am never going to achieve it. The goal that I set was just way too much to be handled by a
                                humble programmer like me alone.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Some friends ask me, are you still with it, man! I thought you had quit long ago. For some
                                reason, I restart it! I am somehow stuck with this idea unable to move on to the next one.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Just stuck on this idea that if I somehow create this application and help people. That is
                                all I want to do now! Let’s see how it goes.
