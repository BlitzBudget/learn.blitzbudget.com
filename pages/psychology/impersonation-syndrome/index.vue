                            <p>
                                understanding that you are insufficient
                                because there is still suffering in your world, knowing what could be done to alleviate
                                that suffering, and then striving to learn, actually learning and then being ok at it
                                then good then a master of that only to find yourself insufficient at another thing and
                                starting it all over again.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                If you really do not love the process of striving you will be like OMG! All that only to
                                start over again?? I was talking to a friend of mine and he was trying hard to explain
                                to my wife that his life is probably harder because of where he is coming from and how
                                less fortunate his childhood was and then how he had to buy a house and then probably
                                pay for their living expenses for their parents in all likelihood for the rest of their
                                lives.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                My wife tried to explain all of the misery that she and her family had to go through to
                                get to where they are currently but soon she got to the point that he had to go through
                                everything that she had to and on top of that he had to go through the life without
                                money.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                We all are absolutely immersed in our experiences and sometimes even though we do not
                                intend to we are ignorant of other people's suffering. His life is most definitely
                                meaningful in a lot of sense and satisfying to know that you can take care of your
                                parents who took care of you. That is suffering and a boon in disguise.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It is all about the perspective in which we are willing to look at the world and derive
                                meaning from that. We can definitely become remorseful about the world and curse god for
                                putting us lower in the hierarchy than our friends and strive to destroy other people's
                                success (My understanding of Jordan Petersons words)
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                But this would do no good other than to put us deeper into a state of misery and enhance
                                our suffering. An untrained mind is an evil mind and an untrained mind has more
                                proclivity towards evil and could even find it more enticing to move towards it.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Which is a part of the reason I started learning about the psychology and human mind.
                                Most of which I learnt from Jordan Peterson. Could not have chosen anybody better for
                                this job actually. He has touched my life in more ways than I can possibly imagine. Part
                                of the reason why I am writing about my psychological journey.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I hardly am a novice in this field only learning or even starting to learn this field
                                but the insights derived from my life would surely be of some use to the rest of the
                                world I suppose. These works sometimes make me feel like all I am doing is understanding
                                and rewording other people's works and as such feel like an imposter.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I had thought about this for a while and came to a conclusion that even though, For the
                                most part, this could be considered exactly that the story and the impact that it had
                                could be of great help and motivation for you to understand more about the important
                                works that Jordan Peterson and Tom Bilyeu are doing and the impact that these people are
                                producing in other peoples lives like mine.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                As a result, you could learn from my life how certain things impact me differently now
                                than they probably did before I started consuming their content. That is almost what I
                                do all day long. It is only after I learnt about psychology that I started appreciating
                                fiction a little bit more and actually found out that it is probably the reason why
                                people say to watch what you see and consume because that is what you will become.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Fictions have a subtleness to them which can impact our subconscious mind without our
                                direct awareness and soon rather than later we start behaving like that. The profound
                                impact of what we consume could never have ever been understood by me otherwise.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Such times exist in our lives when we often feel like we do not have any original ideas
                                I suppose. Those are the time when we have to remember that we are novices still but
                                that should trigger our self-protection mechanism and prevent us from writing or
                                producing anything looking for perfection.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                If I wait for myself to become perfect in a field, I guess that is just my insecurity
                                and the avoidance of the pain circuit that turns on that prevents me from going ahead to
                                produce this content.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Even though the motivation for writing this is impacting other people's lives enough to
                                ensure that we understand ourselves even more and start seeing the world a little bit
                                differently than we did before starting to read this, I guess I am at peace with the
                                fact that I am not the master of the field yet! But soon will be the master of some
                                field but the journey starts with myself integrating the parts of my life that are in
                                disarray.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It was pretty shitty just 10 years ago and now I am happy exactly where I am and would
                                never trade this spot for anything else in this world. Self-doubt, self-hate and
                                self-humiliation are some of the places where I had to work on and accept, understand
                                and come to peace with the fact that it is probably going to be 10 - 15 years of
                                continuous effort before I achieve any meaningful impact in other peoples lives but
                                staying put and waiting for the right moment is not going to make me fulfilled.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Doing this work makes me fulfilled. I also do it selfishly to organize my thoughts and
                                emotions better, it also has the added advantage of making me feel good about creating
                                content that could potentially impact other people's lives.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I would not be doing anything else right now. As many successful people say these
                                failures are stepping stones. And this is exactly what I can do right now which would
                                enable me to do something bigger and better tomorrow. Aim a little bit higher, dare to
                                pursue that higher goal and endure enough to actually achieve it if I am lucky.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Those would forever be out of reach if we never try and dwell in self-hate, self-doubt
                                and feeling like an imposter. Every work in one way or another is a consolidation of
                                other works and derived a new thing on top of the previous works.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The same goes for our personality. Our personality is a direct result of what we consume
                                and what we had consumed in our lives. Which would help us set a goal, aim or direction
                                towards which we need to go.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                And that direction enables us to take our first steps, but as soon as we do something
                                different and actually reach there we also have to be equally willing to strive to bring
                                our loved ones out of that comfort zone that they are in and out above to your new
                                improved position else they would be left feeling stranded and try to pull you down,
                                mock you, cry, kick and bite and make you feel like an imposter if they have to.
                                Understanding that it is a natural precursor to acceptance. We are obliged to be patient
                                and bring our loved ones to this position. This new and improved self would more often
                                than not alienate us from our friends who could no longer connect with us the way they
                                used to before.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It could be that they don’t understand who you have become among other things. But this
                                would inevitably lead to self-doubt. Sometimes we have to ask ourselves and convince
                                ourselves beyond any reasonable doubt relentless improvements in our lives are something
                                that has to keep striving for and nothing else has that impact, the lack of such effort
                                is a path to a meaningless life.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                A fulfilled life is a life lived to its fullest expression. As such, there is no room
                                for any self-doubt.
