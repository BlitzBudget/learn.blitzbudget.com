                            <p>
                                warping the truth and seeing if you buy
                                it or not.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Imagine if you had bought into that idea of warped truth. It means that you cannot see
                                through their deception.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Deception is the form of a lie which is aimed at making you believe something else
                                instead of the truth. Then it might seem as though you are more intelligent than the
                                person that you have deceived.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                You might feel superior to the other person. This is an attempt to parse the subtlest of
                                through which the deceiver shows that they have deceived the other person.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The simplest of the ways is how they treat the other person. Some of them have no
                                respect for the person they just deceived. They might start treating them beneath
                                themselves. Although it applies only to the stupidest of deceivers.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The newbies who just found the art of deception have decided to navigate the world
                                trying to deceive others into getting what they want.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The deception is in rough terms a breach of trust between two parties which actually
                                happened in reality but the deceiver pretends as if the reality never occurs and manages
                                to convince the deceived.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The problem with this is that once the deceived finds out that they have been deceived
                                then it is game over.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The second issue arising out of this is the fact that the deceiver if they have decided
                                to play the art of deception as their main game will have to find other victims.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The third is the deceiver's unwillingness to confront reality as such and navigate
                                through reality to get what they want. Most likely it might take years to reach there
                                and through deception, they might get it now.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                So, in reality, they do not want to put in the work or in rare circumstances use their
                                genuine suffering as an excuse to deceive others. In the 21st century, I hope there is
                                nowhere on earth that this might be rational but I know I am the most ignorant person so
                                who am I to judge those who deceive.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The most important niche that I am trying to focus on is the person who chooses to
                                deceive instead of pursuing the long and thorny road because they do not want to put in
                                the effort to attain it.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                They are the truest of the consumers but not everything can be attained through debt,
                                there are things that money cannot buy which others might have which you might want and
                                might want now.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Fourth is that Wanting what others have is a Zero-sum game as if there is not enough to
                                go around and as such I am going to get what that person has.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                If enough people start doing it then the whole society will become a place where no one
                                can trust anybody and will have to keep a closer eye on their friends than their
                                enemies. It is a miserable place to be in where you have to sleep with one eye open.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The deceiver often treats everyone as if they are less than them and that becomes a
                                habit. Which often seeps through or if someone is cognizant of it they might
                                overcompensate by being too nice and might try to lure you into their deception.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Both extremes are really bad. Disrespecting the deceiver will show their true face to
                                you. That might be some of the ways you might find their true face. That emotion is
                                hidden behind a mask. They think that exposing their true intent and emotion is
                                dangerous and will prevent them from opening up.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The best ones will give you an illusion of being totally candid while having a parallel
                                life to which you are oblivious. It might be none of your business which is exactly what
                                they are trying to say in most cases but if you are the partner and you do not have a
                                parallel life and your partner does then something is wrong.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                These are some of the reasons why people choose to get to the pinnacle of success. You
                                see it takes a great deal of effort and pursuit towards success to reach the pinnacle of
                                democracy.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                We might find the fortunate few who might have inherited them and you know they will
                                lose everything in a generation or two. So who chooses to see the selected unfortunate
                                few who will not have the proclivity to keep what they inherited.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                You see you have to earn what you have if not it does not stick with you. You just will
                                not have the fortification to keep and hold what was given to you.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Live your life aligned with the truth. The truest of deception is deceiving yourself.
                                Never deceive anyone, even you! And move forward. Life could be hard but will be
                                worthwhile.
