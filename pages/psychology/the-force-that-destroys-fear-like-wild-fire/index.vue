                            <h3 class="title">The opposite of fear is courage...</h3>
                            <p>
                                right? When people ask you to be courageous despite the
                                fear what they truly mean is that you would have been willing to channel your fear into
                                paying more attention and factoring in that being ignorant about danger is what causes
                                fear.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The other day I saw a woman on Instagram relaxed in a park, turning back to speak with
                                someone behind when a snack was coming at full speed towards her and she doesn't notice
                                it until the last minute and when she does, she doesn't flinch, she just grabs the snake
                                with her right hand around the neck and swings it in the opposite direction leave it.
                                Man! I was shocked, mesmerized and dum struck at her courage to be able to do it. I was
                                screaming when I saw the video. She knew something that we all didn't, how to handle a
                                snake charging at you at full speed. It traversed the whole park in like 5 seconds.
                                Saying it was fast is just an understatement it was like a Ferrari.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                And she caught it, man! She caught it with her bare hands. My goodness. The fear that
                                ran through my spine is just indescribable. And the way she handled the snake is just
                                admirable and I would love to be that person one day.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Being courageous is admirable. And being cowardly is just a shame, What happens when
                                someone else is hurt because of your cowardice. I was a coward around snakes, I didn't
                                even realize it until I saw the video. It is people like them that encourage us to be a
                                better human beings and encourage us by their acts to become the best version of
                                ourselves despite our fear.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                And the path that we must take is just to understand snakes more I guess. As Jordan
                                Peterson describes, snakes like those appear even in the garden of Eden to change Eve's
                                mind to eat the forbidden apple. Even God! Cannot create a perfect garden free from
                                snakes. How can we ever hope to achieve something that even God himself is unable to
                                achieve?
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                But we can learn to be prepared. Always be prepared and ready for what comes next.
                                Expect the world to treat you as you had treated it in the past. But, expect the worst
                                to come. It comes to the best among us and it is the way we choose to handle and act
                                that defines the man that lives on and succeeds from the one that gives up.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Similarly, you have to give to Jordan to just keep trying to promote the benefits of
                                believing in God! When Nietzsche himself declared that God was dead.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                "God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall we comfort ourselves,
                                the murderers of all murderers? What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has
                                yet owned has bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us? What
                                water is there for us to clean ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games
                                shall we have to invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we not
                                become gods simply to appear worthy of it?"
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                And yet this man, Says believe that God exists within you and behave as though God
                                exists in this world and maybe, just maybe you will be spared from the living hell that
                                most people suffer.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                People like them encourage me to be a better person in life and remind me that morality
                                still exists and we do have a chance to exist on this earth peacefully. And people like
                                Putin, just evoke the opposite emotion. People like those who remind us of the capacity
                                of the human being to kill for the profits of one's ego! It's the worst of the evilest
                                among evil to be so selfish that you are willing to say! give what I want or else! I
                                have a few nuclear warheads to destroy everything and no one will ever get anything and
                                I will take away everything.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                "If I cannot get anything, No one can get anything"
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Those people man! Stay away from them but always prepare to encounter such people. They
                                do exist. I tell you Putin is not the only prick to exist on this planet, and neither is
                                Trump. They are one of a kind! For me to think I was once a Trump fan is just shameful
                                today but I truly believed in what I said and you could see it in my first book "The Art
                                of Building Your Wealth" when I wrote a chapter called "Get a Prenup", it was inspired
                                from his book. I admired his ability to become rich and thought I had to incorporate a
                                part of his mentality and be brutal with people to get what I thought I deserved.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It is plain wrong! It was the wrong type of Knowledge, as Grant Cardone puts it. The one
                                that keeps you poor. I just don't have the privilege to make those types of mistakes and
                                grow. A few of those mistakes can just finish me off for good. But it does not and
                                cannot stop me from trying to get back up and keep trying.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                That is something that I can always do and no one else can stop me from trying. So the
                                opposite of Knowledge is ignorance and ignorance is what keeps us in the dark and it is
                                that darkness that keeps us unprepared to face people like Putin life puts people like
                                Putin in your life and it is exactly when we start feeling fear and even terror. They
                                will destroy and take whatever it is that they want to take from you and leave you there
                                to die.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                So always strive to learn, knowledge is the only salvation and the wrong type of
                                knowledge will put you down for good! but shouldn't ever stop us all from being curious
                                and wanting to learn like a 2-year-old.
