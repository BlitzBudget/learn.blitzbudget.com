                            <p> themselves has always made me wonder if
                                they were faking it. I knew that I had it once but lost it after coming to Spain and
                                searching for it outside.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Expecting some miracle to happen and suddenly me feeling worthy and confident. At least
                                feeling equal to these people living here. All the while handling all the hurdles that
                                life has generously thrown at me. Seeing people so comfortable and without
                                responsibilities also made me wonder how come I suddenly come to a place where the
                                values I held dear never seemed to matter.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                People were single in their 40s free of any responsibilities staying alone for half
                                their lifetime and most likely for the remaining half. And the fact that I was married
                                at the age of 25 raised eyebrows. If society does not value the principles anymore then
                                what is it that they value?
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                As if religious beliefs and all the classic entities like marriage were things of the
                                past and the current period is the transition to a new era where people are exploring
                                all the possibilities. It was also me who wanted to go to Europe and see and live in a
                                developed nation.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I had held Europe and the people living in it above me and my country. This was true to
                                an extent as India is currently a developing country. Like it or not Spain was one of
                                the countries that benefited from imperialism.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                So obviously they had more money, more growth, and more progress than India. Even though
                                the USA was the centre of the world after World War Two. Europe was the battleground. So
                                anyway, I hope I had justified my insecurities. Moving on, the real reason was the
                                emotional intelligence and the way they carried themselves were something to be envied.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I had to grow as a result of the game of imitation and trying to look like them. But, I
                                couldn’t do it successfully, I didn’t feel like myself. It did not represent me in the
                                end. I was probably the least paid back then in my company. All of which made buying
                                things in style a little more expensive. Circumstances, limiting ideologies and low pay
                                bogged me down to a low self-worth setting.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I hear people like Tom Bilyeu say that they use negative emotions to guide them
                                relentlessly to pursue a goal. And that it has never failed to stop motivating them from
                                achieving. I didn’t know it then but that was what I was doing.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It was particularly hard because the road was long and the path was hard. I had to
                                ensure that I did not betray myself ever on that pursuit. Self-betrayal is the second
                                most important point to consider when people are pursuing self-worth.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                When you are building an image of yourself. Then that image has to resonate with your
                                personality and has to be an expression of your personality. Not an imitation of someone
                                else. That imitation will be fake and people will be able to see through that.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                For this reason, not only will you fail but you will try to be someone you are not. That
                                act is self-betrayal because it also means that you are ashamed of portraying your true
                                self. You can be ashamed of your current personality but the solution is not to portray
                                yourself as someone who is not you but to upgrade that inner personality to reflect the
                                person you want to be.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                How can that be done? This can be done only by staring at your vulnerabilities and
                                shortcomings nakedly to understand them, rectifying that part of yourself and becoming a
                                better person overall.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                A classic example is my workout regimen. I had strongly associated myself as a person
                                who was capable of taking just 10 push-ups in one go. Could take up to two to three
                                sets. And the last time I had done something representing workout was 12 years ago when
                                I was a kid. Although up until now I had always thought I would be able to just do 10
                                pushups.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                COVID came around, I became fatter than I already was, then I had knee pain, which
                                started my yoga regime which cured my knee pain, and then slowly but surely o started
                                with exercise. I remember the first time in a long time I tried to take 10 push-ups. I
                                reached 8 and 1/2. Haha!! But my subconscious was shocked to know that my body could not
                                handle it and it rejected that thinking I will get back to it if I tried it for the
                                remainder of the week.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Guess what, I reached 10 push-ups in one go at the end of the first week. Slowly but
                                surely I started doing other exercises for posture correction, abs, biceps and chest.
                                After like 4 months, I started doing 3 sets of full body exercises by Rowan row which
                                included 45 seconds of push-ups.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Guess what, I did 25 push-ups in one go in the first set. 23 in the next and 20.5 in the
                                last set. That added up to 68.5 in one day. As compared to 30 ish which I thought I was
                                capable of handling. My subconscious was shocked again. But guess what the next day, I
                                set a goal that I will do 25 push-ups in 45 seconds.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Guess what my subconscious told me, no way in hell!!! You can do it because your muscles
                                are sore from yesterday and it was just luck that made you do 68.5 yesterday. So in the
                                following 3 sets, every time I got to taking push-ups, I would feel this extreme
                                de-motivation which could demotivate me and put me down. I noticed that, but my body did
                                23, 21 and 19 the next day.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Every time I did anything more than 10 push-ups in one go I told my subconscious. See, I
                                did it. You don’t know what I can do. I have done that four times in 2 weeks and today
                                when I did it, I was somehow confident that I can do it.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The point is, sometimes you have to prove to your subconscious that you can do it even
                                when your subconscious refuses to believe it. You (the conscious self) which only feels
                                when awake and can think are a slave to the subconscious. The subconscious is merely one
                                part, your body being another part and emotion being the link between the body,
                                subconscious and the conscious self.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                That’s just how I currently see myself as lately I also noticed that when I expect
                                something to happen then I automatically anticipate hearing and seeing that before
                                opening the door. When it happens, I am at peace and when that doesn’t happen I am
                                shocked.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                You are held accountable for your capability to predict future outcomes effectively and
                                as Jordan Peterson says, that literally meant life or death for us when we lived in the
                                forest. So I really meant that when we had a bad ideology the payment is death for that
                                error.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Understand that self-worth is earned. It cannot be commanded to exist. You have to
                                convince yourself by achieving before even you are capable of believing in it. So never
                                do anything for anyone. Do it only for yourself. And do it with gusto!!!
