                            <h3 class="title">The Dark Lord was also an orphan...</h3>
                            <p>
                                like Harry Potter. He had to grow up in an orphanage which he hated from his core. Before
                                becoming the Dark Lord, Lord Voldemort was a little tormented boy in an orphanage who was
                                addressed as Tom Riddle. Two people are separated by time and tragedy but one takes it in a
                                negative way and goes down to hell (Tom Riddle) and the other generally takes it in a
                                positive direction (Harry Potter), thereby having a lot of people voluntarily helping him
                                even though he was just an ordinary person hit by a tragedy.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It's all about attitude, man. Taking your tragedy in a positive way just makes it a bit more
                                tolerable. A lot of people would be willing to stay with you when you are humble and
                                positive despite all the tragedy, and maybe you can get through the mess together. It makes
                                a huge difference when you traverse the world alone without anyone by your side. You will
                                not have anyone if you are just being a prick about it. Moreover, imagine tyrannizing the
                                people around you and making yourself slowly immortal, having 7 lives like the Undertaker.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                And one of the Horcruxes is Harry himself. That is the darkness inside our hero who
                                eventually defeats the arch-enemy who has 7 lives. When and how could a person such as Harry
                                himself manage to defeat someone as powerful as Lord Voldemort with a lot of luck and
                                Voldemort making a lot of mistakes.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It is just that when you are a tyrannizer, you cannot afford to make any mistakes in your
                                lifespan. It destroys your reputation as the ultimate perfect creation who was cast upon the
                                earth to rule over the normal population. You just can't afford a mistake. However, when you
                                are a humble student and all you do is make mistakes, and worse, when people start believing
                                that such a student has the potential to defeat Lord Voldemort, the other side gains power
                                as well. As long as Harry lives, hope lives on in the hearts and minds of the people that
                                there was a person who could not be killed by Voldemort.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                In fact, Harry does not do most of the Horcrux hunting. It was Dumbledore who does most of
                                the Horcrux hunting. And Neville Longbottom kills Nagini, the 7th Horcrux, while Voldemort
                                himself kills the last Horcrux, a part of Voldemort's soul that lives on inside of Harry.
                                Harry is simply a vassal used by Dumbledore and serves as a motivation that someone as
                                simple as Harry was finally able to defeat Lord Voldemort out of a technicality.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The holder of 'The Elder Wand,' which was used by Lord Voldemort, in the end, to cast the
                                'Avada Kedavra' spell at Harry, was not actually the owner of the wand. And the real owner
                                was Harry himself. So the intention of Lord Voldemort to kill Harry was the power that
                                killed Lord Voldemort in the end as the spell rebounded again.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Poor Voldemort, man. Embarrassment on top of embarrassment. When Voldemort holds Hagrid as a
                                trap to lure Harry only to try and kill him, only to realize after a while that his attempt
                                to kill Harry was in vain and Harry continues to live. LOL! It is at that moment that the
                                followers of Lord Voldemort flee in droves, leaving Voldemort alone and suffering in
                                embarrassment and defeat.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                When you are the almighty wizard who also holds 'The Elder Wand,' you should practically be
                                immortal even without a Horcrux. That is exactly why he holds Nagini, The Elder Wand, and
                                his pride so close to his heart. At the same time, he underestimates other people's ability
                                and willpower only to find out that Neville Longbottom finishes off his last Horcrux, which
                                leaves Lord Voldemort vulnerable but still having an upper hand over others.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                He holds the skill and the wand to defeat the best of the best. With his cunningness, he
                                wouldn't mind killing every single person on earth like the Chinese leader Mao and Russian
                                Leader Stalin. With all this, he loses because of a technicality. That's life, buddy! That's
                                the world's first life lesson to take away.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Never be cocky and never have the intentions to inflict harm on others simply to feel
                                superior over them and reign over them. It is precisely that intention which will be your
                                downfall. Unfortunately, in life, it is definitely not a guarantee if you hold the ultimate
                                power in your country like Mao or Stalin. Mao simply died because of his chain-smoking
                                habits. It is those whom he reigned over who ultimately suffered the consequences of his
                                tyranny.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I am pretty sure that it wouldn't have been believable if J.K. Rowling presented Harry
                                Potter to be the person who fought Voldemort in a fair battle and won. It just isn't
                                possible. The lesson to be taken in the end would be that taking life positively would
                                ensure that you have a really high probability to ensure that the suffering that the world
                                offers is bearable and that the burden that you would have to personally carry is lessened
                                to a large degree, as others would be voluntarily willing to carry the suffering for you.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                On the contrary, if you are an evil-doer and want to tyrannize over whom you rule with
                                absolute authority, then the result might be the necessity for absolute perfection to a
                                degree that is humanly impossible and nobody to trust or shoulder your burden. You would
                                just use them or kill them if you think they are a threat.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Why kill Severus Snape when all he had to do was defeat him in a wand battle and cast the
                                'Expelliarmus' charm, right? That disarming charm is what made Harry the owner of 'The Elder
                                Wand' when he cast the spell on Draco Malfoy.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Such is the intention of Lord Voldemort who is not willing to compromise and willing to kill
                                people to take what they want and to even do it cruelly without any mercy. You don't want to
                                stay around people like them. You know that nothing good is ever going to come by hanging
                                around people like that. A self-obsessed, self-proclaimed narcissist with a superiority
                                complex and absolute hatred that he even kills his father and grandfather for putting him in
                                the orphanage. A person does not get any worse. He is Satan himself. The opposite of an
                                Angel.
