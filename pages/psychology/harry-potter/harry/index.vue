                            <p>
                                first he is a small kid who is orphaned due to an
                                accident which killed their parents and lives with his aunt and uncle until he is eligible
                                to enter Hogwarts.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Such a person is probably the weakest possible contender to choose when we think about a
                                hero. We all imagine a hero to be all bulked up with a sword in his hand fighting a dragon.
                                But the fact that he is a 10-year-old orphan just makes it all the more interesting when he
                                struggles to contend with the almighty Voldemort. A man, so evil that saying his name is
                                banned. Are you kidding me??
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                In a one-on-one glorious battle, Harry would have lasted for like 0.5 seconds against Lord
                                Voldemort. But the story starts when the Dark Lord is at his weakest and Harry is just some
                                random kid who doesn't know magic yet. Pairing them against each other does not even seem
                                fair to begin with. To make matters worse, the Dark Lord cannot even be killed and he keeps
                                coming back even when the 'Avada Kedavra' spell rebounded.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                How do you defeat someone who cannot be killed and is so powerful that you do not call him
                                by his name? But Harry! 'The boy who lived' is also a legend among the magic community. It's
                                just amazing how Lord Voldemort intertwined his fate simply by choosing to act first and try
                                to kill a newborn child. The spell rebounds and his soul has to wander in the shadows living
                                in the dark corner of the forest, completely contradictory to his former glory.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Yet he lives on in the memory of the wizards, waiting to return and take over the world. An
                                enemy as cunning and powerful as that does not expect to be taken down by a newborn baby.
                                This legacy is also what binds Harry to the Dark Lord.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Things get more interesting when Harry finds out that there is a piece of darkness inside of
                                him which can be tapped into by Lord Voldemort. It is true in real life as well. The
                                darkness lives inside every single one of us and can be seen and used by the dark forces.
                                The resentment that people carried after the First World War in Germany is what caused the
                                Second World War after Hitler tapped into the dormant emotions, shame, and the absurdity of
                                the Versailles agreement which ensured that the Germans paid for their mistakes of WWI. It
                                is probably by far the worst mistake made.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The wizards seem to be segregated in their alliance, either serving the Dark Lord or normal
                                people just minding their own business. Harry, being tormented by his past and the current
                                ongoing suffering that he endures from his aunt and uncle just because his mother was a
                                wizard, is pure injustice. He is sometimes locked in the closet and punished, while Dudley
                                is given everything and is seen as the polar opposite where he just takes everything for
                                granted and keeps asking for more. When you dramatize that, it gives us the perfect example
                                of the injustices happening inside the same household, where one person has just too much
                                and the other is left to scrape the leftovers.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Harry is seen as a subjugated person under the Dursey family's household, and it is no
                                wonder that when he joins Hogwarts, he does everything that the school demands that you do
                                not do. You can only suppress a person so much, and all the frustration of not being able to
                                do what he wanted to do in childhood and the sheer naivety of the mischiefs done by Harry,
                                Hermione, and Ron should be seen as endeavors performed by kids who just didn't have an
                                opportunity to do such acts back at home.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Whenever they give a slip and disappear to find Hagrid or find something because of their
                                curiosity, they are often pardoned by Hagrid and even Dumbledore for their atrocities. At
                                school, you are required to obey the law. What's the fun in that? Let's see the outcast and
                                hear interesting stories about the forbidden forest and the Philosopher's Stone.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                They choose Hagrid because Hagrid was the one who initially came to rescue Harry from the
                                Dudleys, and Harry knew Hagrid to be a friendly person who has the softest of hearts and is
                                most empathetic. Kids see those traits. It is precisely that curiosity about the unknown and
                                wanting to learn about the dangers which make the trio most notable.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                They stick together, man. It is exactly what creates a bond. An external enemy and a joint
                                curiosity to find out the enemy who wants to create havoc in Hogwarts. The path from knowing
                                nothing to finding something about the enemy and somehow defeating the enemy together
                                creates an eternal bond.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                That is exactly the reason why a nerd muggle, a subjugated orphan, and a normal broke child
                                could hang out together. What held them together despite whatever happened was the shared
                                curiosity and the experiences that followed as a result of pursuing the path to find out
                                more about the danger.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                This is the traditional hero myth where the hero goes to the dungeon to slay the dragon to
                                rescue the virgin! It need not be the courage that took them forward; it might have just
                                been the curiosity despite the fear and terror. We see them in all the ghost movies. Why
                                would they walk in the dark with a small candle despite their fear? Curiosity!!
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Often times we see him fail. He is no way near perfect. He almost always doesn't know what
                                to know. He is made fun of all the time by Draco Malfoy, and people laugh at him and Ron. He
                                is defeated in wizardry. What saves him all the time are the people around him and the
                                forces that gather around Harry because of Dumbledore.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Harry's parents have formed an alliance to work and destroy Lord Voldemort, and the remnant
                                of that former alliance is what almost always saves him from trouble. Dumbledore is the one
                                who sends Harry the Invisible Cloak for Christmas. Why would a headmaster do that? It is
                                almost like he is inviting Harry to explore the forbidden realms of Hogwarts.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                He finds "The Mirror of Erised" as a direct consequence of using the "Cloak of Invisibility"
                                and gets drawn and stuck with the delusions fed by the magic mirror. It is almost like the
                                mirror wants all of your time and would like to pay for it by showing what you deeply
                                desire. Harry is by no means perfect. He is one of us! As broken as we are, as clueless as
                                we are. He had Dumbledore though at his side. It made all the difference.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It reminds me of the necessity of having a good mentor. In fact, the best mentor. The best
                                mentor is the one that is currently what you would love to be 30 years down the line. The
                                best of the best, guiding you! No matter how many times you fail, you are bound to succeed
                                with such guidance. Harry initially can only be seen as a pawn in the game. A normal kid who
                                is driven by fate to bring down "He who must not be named."
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It also signifies the importance of having people on your side and convincing them to work
                                together to achieve a common goal while having an effective mentor. We cannot achieve
                                anything alone in life. We also need an ambition or a goal. Better if you are forced to do
                                it and have no other option but to "Do or Die."
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                When we are usually faced with death, we often find a way to ensure that we live. With luck,
                                motivation, and a lot of people at your side, maybe, you can avoid death. As seen in all the
                                series of Harry Potter, Lord Voldemort tries to kill Harry, not because he thinks Harry is
                                the arch opponent. No! Because Harry is an embarrassment to Lord Voldemort and reminds him
                                of his failure. Tyranny hates failure. He chose to die trying to kill Harry rather than
                                live.

                                <br>
                                Harry is the person who chose to make Harry the hero of the story. Despite his weaknesses
                                and challenges, Harry possesses qualities that make him a remarkable protagonist. He
                                embodies resilience, compassion, and the ability to forge deep connections with others.
                                These traits, combined with his unwavering determination, propel him forward on his journey.

                                <br>
                                Throughout the series, Harry faces numerous obstacles and confronts his own inner demons. He
                                battles not only external threats but also his own fears, doubts, and insecurities. His
                                struggle to come to terms with his identity as the "Boy Who Lived" and his connection to
                                Voldemort adds layers of complexity to his character.

                                <br>
                                Moreover, Harry's experiences of injustice and mistreatment fuel his empathy for others who
                                have suffered. He understands the pain of being marginalized, and this drives him to stand
                                up against injustice and protect those who are vulnerable. His friendships with Ron and
                                Hermione, as well as his loyalty to Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix, demonstrate his
                                unwavering commitment to fighting for what is right.

                                Harry's journey is not just about defeating Voldemort; it's about personal growth,
                                self-discovery, and the power of love and friendship. He learns valuable lessons about
                                sacrifice, forgiveness, and the importance of choosing one's path. His ability to find
                                strength in the face of adversity inspires readers and teaches them about the resilience of
