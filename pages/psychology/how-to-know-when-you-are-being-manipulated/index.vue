                                surrounding yourself with good people. Guess what, I was more times in a more
                                manipulative relationship than most of you guys and I did not in any way understand it
                                when I was in them and was forced to confront the reality when I could no longer ignore
                                it. And those were really painful experiences that I would never wish upon my worst
                                enemies yet, it happens to everybody all the time. It is a constant that most of us are
                                doomed to be at one time or another. A quote from Friedrich Nietzsche comes to my mind.

                                I wish people could understand where he is coming from. Those are the things that move
                                people towards self enlightening and wisdom, We no longer navigate the world like we
                                navigated when we were 18 years of age. That is because life had thought us that if we
                                were that naive then we would be enticed into all the manipulative relationships,
                                enticed into buying the things that we do not want to or even a subpar product because
                                of a damn good marketing strategy only to regret buying it later. Confronted with all of
                                this, One could look up and ask "Why the hell is this happening to me???"
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                How about this as an answer. "To help you become a better human being focused towards
                                good, To help you protect your loved ones from misery and suffering in the future, To
                                navigate the world effectively and move successfully towards your goal in the future".
                                All of these require us to inevitably navigate through suffering, deceit, manipulation
                                and betrayal to effectively reach where we want. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I guarantee you that along the way you could see people living more comfortably with
                                much less effort than you had to put in because of the time and place where you were
                                born and the parents that you were born into. That could be so disheartening to people
                                at times, Those are the factors that you could never control and is no use pondering
                                about. I would rather go through all of those things than be born as a child of some
                                billionaire somewhere. Because the path of a spoiled son is downwards like a rocket with
                                a double turbo engine doing down at supersonic speed (Borrowing this quote from The
                                Print youtube channel). 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I would look at them when they are 50 or 60 when they come down to millionaire status
                                with pity when they have effectively destroyed fortunes and I would value those who
                                could own a single home by working hard and taking care of their children and wife while
                                staying devoted to them. Full respect for you guys man. Honestly, All I could feel is
                                respect towards them. But we all have the self-limiting mentality that makes us and the
                                others around us miserable. If a self-restricting mentality is bad for us then
                                restricting your loved ones is satanic. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                So even if not for yourself or for the love that you have for the ones around you
                                destroy those beliefs by being genuinely curious and just wishing to be more informed
                                and learn genuinely like a 5-year-old kid every day without prejudice, without any
                                complex, ego, hatred or jealousy. The reality is those emotions would only come in the
                                way of learning and it is precisely when you do that, you will encounter new people
                                around you, Some of them would then move towards becoming your new best friends and some
                                would just be like a love-hate relationship or just formal. In between would be
                                loneliness and self-growth.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                After all this, We would find ourselves with fewer and fewer manipulative, jealous
                                people around us who would not only let themselves grow but neither their friends nor
                                family. Stop being around them. How do you find them? By first labelling anything that
                                comes out of your mouth or anybody's mouth, You do not even have to say it out loud.
                                Just identify self-restrictive ideologies or thoughts. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Identifying and labelling is the first step towards being less miserable. I cannot
                                stress this point enough, Identifying as many self-defeating thoughts as possible is the
                                cornerstone for self-improvement. Meticulously strive to identify those thoughts. It
                                could even be prevalent among your whole society and deeply entrenched that you don't
                                even identify it as a self restraint. Go that deep man. And then as your self why? Why
                                do you need to follow those constraints? and would breaking them move you toward good or
                                evil. The compass that you have to use is the one called Morality in my opinion. I would
                                see everything under the moral compass and use it to help me move towards good. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I am not talking about religious morality. I define morality as a pretty simple thing. A
                                win, win-win strategy. A win for you personally, A win for your competitors and a win
                                for society. Anything that is fostered on the conscious intention of destroying
                                something, or someone for the mere pleasure of inflicting pain on others like an act of
                                revenge would be an immoral act. You can judge me for being moral, You cannot however in
                                good conscious say that your compass is pure logic and no emotions. Because it has been
                                scientifically proven that logic works in tandem with emotions. If we turn off our
                                emotions we just wouldn't be motivated to take action, any action but all we do every
                                day is do something. And we are not dead yet, It simply means that emotions are keeping
                                you alive and kicking. Being capitalistic and materialistic is just one step in the
                                wrong direction. There has to be a balance in life with emotions, body and soul to guide
                                us in the right direction to be self-fulfilled in life. That fulfilment is what has to
                                be desired in life. Don't think that he is preventing me from achieving something but
                                why are you giving him or her the power to control or restrict you in any way. The first
                                step comes in believing that despite the circumstance you can thrive, remove the
                                constraints or remove yourself from those circumstances and just focus on being good
                                long enough that that becomes your identity. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                You identify yourself as a person who is self-aware, conscious and aligned towards good.
                                If life is punishing you just too much, then ask, if it could have been prevented
                                somehow, Were your actions in any way changed and a different outcome could have been
                                expected instead of this undesirable circumstance that you are currently in right now?
                                These are the types of questions that would save you and push you away from manipulative
                                behaviour. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                When I was around manipulative people, Me being me was completely honest with everyone
                                around me and just was being myself. I noticed that I would feel closer to them but they
                                would not necessarily reciprocate. I would feel friction, for example when I ask them do
                                you want to hang out this evening and have a drink? They would be like, "No I am sorry,
                                I have other plans". That's ok if it is just once right? But They do not call you and
                                you are the only one calling them 100% of the time when you do speak, they say "hmm" or
                                are silent more often in a weird way that leaves you with mixed emotions about the
                                conversation it often means that 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                1) they did not convey their emotions clearly and stayed quiet to not offend you or be
                                polite.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                2) Or they are not that comfortable sharing what was going on in their mind. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The manipulators use that space, where it could either be good or bad. And prefer to
                                stay within that spear of confusion almost always. And even after years you still could
                                not reliably feel good about that relationship. Vanesa Van Edwards put it bluntly which
                                was extremely enlightening for me. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                "When people are not happy when you succeed at something and enjoy that moment of
                                happiness with you when you ride it. "
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                You know for certain that they are frenemies. It could be your partner, parents, friends
                                or relatives. It could be that they are not as excited about it as you or have no
                                excitement at all or worse have exactly the negative effect. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                One possible definition is that your definition of success is entirely inverted and you
                                are digging yourself a big grave or that that person is not happy with your success and
                                you have to hide certain truther from people. When they become insecure around you but
                                truly wish that you succeed and quickly overcome that insecurity and wish good for you.
                                It is often pardonable and that does not mean you have to become less successful to keep
                                them around. It just means that your growth was phenomenal enough to trigger
                                insecurities around them. Give them the space and time to get comfortable with that and
                                see you as that person if it is someone that you cannot lose no matter what. Bring them
                                up to your ideology and more often than not, they would start earning more, doing more
                                and as a result being more successful. This would be dually beneficial. You could keep
                                that relationship and grow together. It could be harder than usual but possible.

                                Other types of manipulators come into your life clothed as sheep when they are a fox and
                                enter deep into your house and mess everything up when they have an opportunity. It is
                                them that are harder to identify. Those people enjoy and seem happy about your success
                                and are experts in hiding their emotions. You could easily identify them when you know
                                little to nothing about them but everything about you is known to the,m Classic
                                manipulators.

                                Manipulators think information, emotionally sensitive information is the most valuable
                                commodity there is to it and would prevent themselves most times from telling the truth
                                or something that they are emotional over. Would never show signs of weakness or
                                vulnerability; If they show vulnerability and are weak then they would bitch about you
                                behind your back and throw in negative emotions in your circle and if that succeeds you
                                would start losing your friend circle. Know that they are being manipulated and you are
                                paying the price. Be a better person, leave them alone, Identify that they do not need
                                to be disturbed, and Be comfortable being around yourself. Then continually improve so
                                that you do not need anyone around you to feel comfortable with yourself.

                                It just makes you a lot stronger than you currently are, which then attracts better
                                people and tries to resonate with them. In between all of this is loneliness, and
                                suffering but there is also, self-healing, self-growth, and self-understanding. All of
                                which would have never been possible without loneliness, suffering, misery, and
                                betrayal. Never go down the revenge path. It is a dark energy that does no good in the
                                long term. be aligned towards the light always. And you will move towards living a more
                                fulfilling life.
