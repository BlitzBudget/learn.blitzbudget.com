                            <p>
                                Every goddamn thing in moderation. Emotions, man! It's a complicated world, where we can
                                find people who have completely shut their emotions and simply live their lives planning for
                                everything and preventing their emotions from surfacing as much as possible, to the ones
                                that are over-emotional and could not control what they feel, how they feel, and when they
                                feel it.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                But greed is also an emotion. The want for power comes from a deep emotion of feeling
                                belonging, wanting to rule over everything else, or just the need to be successful which
                                comes from a need to prove to yourself that you are worth it. It all comes from some kind of
                                emotion in the end. Deeply powerful forces. This is why it is so easy for us to segregate
                                emotions into positive ones and negative ones.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                With positive ones propagating you further into society, enriching you and everyone else
                                around you. The negative ones probably could be for preventing any harm that could be done
                                to you (Self-defense) or deliberate harm that could be done to others because you are
                                jealous of others. A million rich farmers were killed by Mao, and similarly, a million rich
                                farmers were killed by Stalin to redistribute wealth to the poor people. What has that done
                                to the world, man? It could even seem just to get rid of a few for the hundreds of millions
                                to prosper. That's not what happened. After 2 - 3 years of prosperity, 25 - 45 million
                                people died out of starvation in China, and around 10 million people died out of starvation
                                due to Stalin.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                You kill a million rich people, and you have to pay the price. It is simple proof that
                                people do not become rich by stealing from others. They become rich by contributing to
                                society, and without them, any system cannot prosper. We need the rich people around, and we
                                need the middle-class people around. There is no communist utopia where everyone is in the
                                middle class, and people live happily ever after. It seems even birds have hierarchies. The
                                best and the ablest ones live around the best food sources, and the unhealthy or
                                comparatively underprivileged ones live on the outskirts where less food is found. It's
                                called the pecking order.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                We are not birds, right? Not lobsters, we are bigger, better, and more intelligent. Well,
                                guess what? With more intelligence comes more power. And with more power comes more
                                possibilities to ensure that others suffer while you thrive. It’s one of the possibilities.
                                And even if you consciously do not want other people to suffer, it seems to be a direct
                                consequence of the government's inability to provide for the poor. It seems to take from the
                                rich to pay the poor. Playing Robinhood seems to fix the problem.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I don’t think so, man. It’s never too simple. The governments would have to be powerful
                                enough to ensure that the taxpayers and society's most vulnerable population are taken care
                                of and are not homeless like they are in the US.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                If you are homeless, you are just not working hard enough, is just not right, man! It’s just
                                not right! It seems like delegating the responsibility back to the poor and assuming that we
                                all made it simply due to hard work.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                As if luck has nothing to do with it. Luck plays a huge role. When my brother-in-law shamed
                                a waiter back in India for not being understanding enough, you don’t do that. Full stop. No
                                ifs and buts.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                We will probably be exactly in that position if we were both under these circumstances. Who
                                knows, man! We would most probably be exactly there.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                You wouldn’t want a rich person to say, “You filthy peasant,” now would you? It’s plain
                                ignorant, arrogant, and irresponsible for all of us to do such a disservice to other human
                                beings.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                It is exactly why having an ounce of morality in our souls and letting it guide us would not
                                be so bad for me and the rest of the world as such.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Me first! I had to relearn the use of morality, and its integration into myself took like
                                one and a half years. I had to let go of all the morality and its sense when I first came
                                here to Spain, only to relearn all of it after 5 years. I was just too stubborn to let
                                anybody close.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I still do not know why I did it. Probably because of fear. I don’t know whether that means
                                that I left my morality in India. Well, I didn’t know how to behave morally in Spain, even
                                though I had it in me, to be honest. I just figured out that I am going to be who I am, just
                                the way I am. And others would just have to learn my way.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                There is no other way to move on, man! There is no other way that I could find. I am
                                learning their language and their culture as much as I possibly can. At least until then, I
                                have to get my confidence back and navigate the world.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                And navigation without a moral compass is just plain impossible. With such a moral compass
                                as our guides, I am sure we would all live a much better life where we let a lot of space
                                for others to grow and prosper, including nature itself.
