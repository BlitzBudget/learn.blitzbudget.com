                in a civilized world develops the opportunity for inequality
                <br />
                <br />
                The opportunists seize every opportunity to make a profit.
                <br />
                <br />
                They deserve every single penny they make out of it while the
                others stay in ignorance of these opportunities.
                <br />
                <br />
                There are two factors at play here:
                <br />
                <br />
              </p>
              <ul>

                <br />
                <br />
                Though the opportunity was available to all of them, only the
                opportunist were able to see the opportunity at hand.
                <br />
                <br />
                This is only made possible with the help of Leverage.

                <h3>Leverage</h3>
                <p>
                  Let’s say that there is an opportunity to make money by
                  cleaning a house. You could do it in a number of ways.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Use a plain old broom and a mop to clean the house (1 hour)
                  </li>
                  <li>Use a vacuum cleaner to clean the house (30 min)</li>
                  <li>Use an automated robotic cleaner (Automated)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>What does this mean financially?</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>You could spend one hour to clean the house (Free)</li>
                  <li>
                    You could hire someone to do it for you ($10.62 per hour)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    You could also buy a vacuum cleaner to make it easier ($60 –
                    $200)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    You could buy an automated robotic cleaner ($200 – $1000)
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Depending on your region and country, all these figures will
                  vary but the point remains that you are saving time/money
                  depending on what you are willing to choose.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>You could spend one hour to clean the house (Free)</li>
                  <li>
                    If you prioritize your time, you would be choosing to hire
                    someone to do the house cleaning for you (Automated /
                    Manual).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If you prioritize your money, you would be cleaning it
                    yourself.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Leverages here are Vacuum Cleaner, Robotic Cleaners, and Man
                  Power.
                </p>
                <p>Let’s take a financial example this time.</p>
                <p>
                  I have a $100 in my bank account and you have a $100 million
                  in your bank account.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We both choose to invest it in a low-risk index fund which
                  yields a moderate 8% annual return on investment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After a year, My initial $100 would have become $108 while
                  your $100 million would have become $108 million.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Even though we both had equal opportunity, you were able to
                  make the most of the index fund investment.
                </p>
                <p>What is the Leverage here?</p>

                To add insult to injury, I’ve earned all of my $100 while you

                Now, I may feel life is unequal!
              </p>
              <p>In reality, it is not.</p>
              <p>
                Your parents may have worked hard and deserved every penny of
                what they have earned and then passed it on to you.

                If you are unaware of an unpleasant situation, you cannot be
                troubled by it. <br />
                Initially, the wealth gap between you and me was $99,999,900.
              </p>
              <p>
                After a year, the wealth gap between you and me has widened to
                $107,999,892.
              </p>
              <p>
                A classic example of
                <strong>Rich getting richer, poor becoming poorer</strong>.
              </p>
              <p>
                While this fact is true, inflation is also catching up to eat up
                what I’ve earned in interest, along with tax payment to the
                government and costs involved with the fund.
              </p>
              <p>
                The real return on investment could be anywhere between $2 – $6
                while you could be looking forward to earning anywhere between
                $2 million to $6 million.
              </p>
              <p>
                Your parents might have worked hard; learnt along the way to
                become the best in their fields to accumulate and provide you a
                $100 million. While mine did nothing and provided me with a
                total inheritance of $0.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is in every parent’s interest to ensure that their children
                have every bit of advantage in this world.
              </p>
              <p>
                Meanwhile, if I ensure that I spend every little penny that I
                have left and leave my children with a net inheritance of $0 I
                ensure misery to my children.
              </p>
              <p>
                Again a classic example of
                <strong>Rich getting richer, poor becoming poorer.</strong>
              </p>
              <p>What can we learn here?</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The lesser the resources, the harder it is to save.</li>
                <li>The more the money, the easier it is to save.</li>
                <li>I spend everything which I earn and invest.</li>
                <li>
                  You could never imagine spending $8 million a year. So, you
                  end up investing it again.

                If you are determined enough and are motivated sufficiently. You
                will eventually earn your first million in the 30 + years of
                your career. <br />
                Always remember

              <p>Earn -> Save -> Invest -> Repeat</p>
              <p>
                It is the only recipe which promises the attainment of your
                financial goals.
              </p>
              <p>But don’t people who invest end up losing money?</p>
              <p>
                These are the people who do not do their homework before
                investing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Just like other industries, the Investment sectors are full of
                gold diggers. You must be aware of it and make sound investment
                decisions with the least risk.
              </p>
              <p>
                In order to be aware of what makes an investment sound, you need
                to keep learning about the art of making money.
              </p>
              <p>
                Be inquisitive; strive to learn; every little experience is a
                lesson on what works and what does not.

                It would generally take me 2 – 3 generations if I am lucky to
                get from where I am today to catch up with say $100 million net
                worth if everything goes right.
              </p>
              <p>
                But if enough people like me think that inequality is the root
                of all evil and decide to revolt against it, maybe we can throw
                away the current government and manage to press the reset button
                on the inequality.
              </p>
              <p>
                When the civilizations start building a society again, it is
                inevitable that the inequality will breed again.
              </p>
              <p>
                According to Walter Scheidel, a professor of Roman History at
                Stanford University and the author of “The Great Leveler”, there
                are only four factors which have the ability to reset the
                problem of inequality –
                <strong>war, disease, State collapse and revolution</strong>. But as soon
                as the devastation is over, income inequality builds again.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the process of destroying inequality, we will risk destroying
                the whole civilization as we know it. Simple to start from the
                scratch again.
              </p>
              <p>
                Do you really want to reset all the achievements that your
                country has gone through simply because you do not have the
                patience to wait until the money compounds to $100 million after
                2 – 3 generations?
