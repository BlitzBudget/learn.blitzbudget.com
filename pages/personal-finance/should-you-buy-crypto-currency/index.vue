              <h3 class="title">The hot topic now is crypto or NFT...</h3>
              <p>
                People all around us constantly shouting to buy Crypto including Tom
                Bilyeu and Robert Kiyosaki author of Rich Dad and poor dad. Understand that those who shout are using
                crypto as a way to either save a portion of their portfolio of investments in Crypto or is a gambling
                account for them in which they just buy it and forget and are comfortable with the amount reaching zero.
                <br>
                <br>
                If that is truly your only way to invest then it is truly not a good way of handling your accounts.
                First, Crypto is not investing, Day trading is not investing, It is gambling. Don't take my word for it,
                take it from Warren Buffet or even Ray Dalio, He never said Crypto is gambling but he never suggests
                ever just putting all the eggs in one basket especially solely on crypto.
                <br>
                <br>
                It would make more sense to just put the money that you are comfortable with going to zero. In reality,
                it wouldn't but trust me it is truly unpredictable. So just put the money that you do not want and never
                use leverage to gamble with Crypto. The average person like me never can afford to gamble let alone
                gamble with leverage. I see a lot of my peers and friends enticed into buying Crypto. it has that luring
                effect to it I suppose. Like the witches who entice us with their beauty only to eat us alive and take
                everything we have.
                <br>
                <br>
                One such experience is more than enough to ensure that we never gamble or even invest ever again. It is
                also not advisable to hold cash and stay on cash for eternity with the current inflation rates (2022) it
                is highly unreasonable to hold cash while you can invest. It, however, does not mean using all your cash
                on investing but investing only a certain portion of your income into it. Start with 50 Euro or anything
                that you are comfortable with and see how it goes and slowly start increasing it. I only suggest very
                very low-cost index funds and bonds. It does not make any sense to invest in mutual funds. Read the
                books by John C. Bogle to understand why not to invest in mutual funds and why you would be paying a lot
                more than they say.
                <br>
                <br>
                Funds like the Vanguard index funds are the best investment funds. If you are still not convinced by it,
                Let me ask you a question. What is it that is motivating you to invest in Crypto? Ask yourself that
                question, It always goes down to some fundamental need. That fundamental need can be the need to be
                recognized and not feel crappy about yourself or be successful. Being successful is so shallow that it
                does not make any sense. What I mean by that is success takes time. Instant gratification is never the
                answer. I see the potential to become a millionaire in Crypto but 95% of people lose money so 5% can
                become millionaires. Trust me when I say this, If you are planning to invest in Crypto now, you are not
                the 5%. You are in the 95% who make little to no money or mostly are going to lose money.
                <br>
                <br>
                And do not treat crypto or stock as an investment and Cost Average on it. Meaning steadily investing a
                standard amount every month without fail and expecting to produce a gain in the long term. It is like
                buying a piece of art, The demand is entirely dependent on people wanting to own it and I strongly feel
                that those who have already bought Crypto need to push people to want to buy more Crypto so the price is
                going to keep increasing. But understand the beneficiary are those who already have the Crypto
                investment, not us who are going to invest in them. For an average person it never really makes any
                sense to use Crypto as an investment vehicle. Use Bonds, and Index Funds as investment tools or as Ray
                Dalio says even during inflation buy inflation-linked bonds.
                <br>
                <br>
                And after you consider yourself successful and have like 30% of your total assets on safe investments,
                then and only then use Crypto. If you are owning 100 Euros of Crypto no one cares. Go ahead and buy them
                by all means. Even Crypto stocks. Who cares about 100 or even 300 euros worth of Crypto man? It makes no
                meaningful sense to take about those scenarios. Imagine a millionaire investing 10,000 Euros in Crypto
                it is 1% of their total investments in Crypto.
                <br>
                <br>
                If you truly think Crypto, NFT and other blockchain related technologies are going to be the next big
                thing that people are going to flock over, think again. The government of India and many other
                governments have Cryptocurrency banned at least as of 2022. And it does not make sense to expect them to
                accept them with open arms, They are going to use their teeth and claws to resist a free-floating
                currency to be used as a dominant currency. That is a loss of power over finances. Only the country
                loses power as fundamental as the power to control its finances. All hell breaks loose. The only other
                sense would be to go to war over other countries for minor conflicts because sanctions would no longer
                make any sense. Like Europe sanctioning Russia over Ukraine Russia War. Sanctions are only effective if
                you have the power to prevent transactions from this country to the next. That is harder with Crypto.
                I do understand with all my heart that China is planning to launch its version of the country backed
                virtual currency and link that with their existing authoritarian centralized reward system to penalize
                or reward based on how loyal they are to CCP.
                <br>
                <br>
                That is a different story altogether, That shows an example of how virtual currencies can be used by an
                authoritarian system but it is not a free-floating block chain system which not backed by any
                government. As long as a government backs crypto and uses it as an official currency system which BTW is
                never going to happen. A country is more likely to create a virtual currency like how China is planning
                to thereby ensure total control over that virtual currency. So the only thing that is ever going to be
                the key factor in the rise and fall of prices of the Cryptocurrency is only the customer demand and once
                people understand that, They will start thinking about timing the market and predicting the spike in
                demand.
                <br>
                <br>
                I tell you that is fundamentally a wrong way of going about with finances and it is not going to take
                you anywhere good. Tread carefully in those waters. Consider yourself warned my friends. These are the
                risks of gambling. If you cannot afford to gamble do not gamble.

                If you are not happy along the way towards success, why does it matter? Sometimes you have to wait for
                your loved ones to grow along with you.

              <p>Give them the opportunity and the freedom to do so with your newly acquired wealth; else you will leave

                Money makes us happy but the happiness which we experience rarely persists. Speaking and connecting with
                others provides lasting happiness when compared to the money. Without your loved ones around you,
                success and money mean nothing.

                We can all learn to be happy first by living a purposeful and meaningful life by making others around us

              <p>
                The most selfless of all the needs in the path to becoming financially free is also the purest form of
                love. Contribution without expectation can be the greatest motivator. As Tony Robbins in the book “Money
                - master the game” said: “All I had was $14 and I gave it all away to the little gentleman who treated
                his mother like a lady in the restaurant”. It motivated him to achieve and be important in this life.
                <br />
                Now, Tony Robbins is worth millions of dollars. He still feeds a lot of people. He fed 100 million
                people recently. Of course with the help of others. It gives him a sense of purpose.

              <p>
                What is your motivation? Contribute today. Don’t wait till you make more money. Providing one dollar to
                the needy is contributing.

              <h4>
                Draining all of your Will Power
              </h4>
              <p>
                Have you ever experienced the feeling of giving up on your pursuit to something? That’s the feeling of
                failure… Have you ever pushed yourself so hard to complete a task which you started?
              </p>
              <p>
                While staying motivated to learn about personal finance, I’ve pushed myself too hard to complete a book
                by John C. Bogle - “Bogle on Mutual Funds”.
              </p>
              <p>
                The book was so dry and empty of emotions. No wonder they call him data devil. Any book which is void of
                emotion is a textbook of sort. It lacks the depth to connect with the reader but provides immense value
                to them.
              </p>
              <p>
                I’ve learned as much as all the other personal finance books combined from Bogle on Mutual Funds. The
                value provided was immense but too daunting.
              </p>
              <p>
                While reading a book, I do not just whoosh through it. I make sure to sustain as much knowledge as
                possible from the act of reading a book. I still vividly remember my motivation being drained slowly but
                steadily as I read through it.
              </p>
              <p>
                As I finished reading half of the book, I realized that I didn't have any more motivation to read
                through it. I had to push myself to read the book very next day. It was daunting! It took me another 15
                days to finish reading it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Having used all of my willpower to finish reading, I never touched another book for a whole month and it
                took another two or three months to slowly start recovering from it. I had to re-motivate myself to
                start learning more about personal finance.
              </p>
              <p>
                I swore to never do such a stupid thing ever in my life. I had wasted so much time not reading anything.
                I felt too low for not learning anything for one whole month. So I started learning about personal
                finance slowly.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lesson learnt, <strong>Never drain your willpower to do any act! Learn to motivate yourself to learn
                  instead</strong>.
