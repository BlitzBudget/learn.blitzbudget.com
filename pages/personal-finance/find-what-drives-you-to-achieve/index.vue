              <p>Let’s find out what drives us to achieve. A good number of people do the jobs they do not love to
                earn the riches they desire. If you have just enough determination, passion and desire to
                achieve and consistently outperform, financial success will be the byproduct. But we all know
                the person who works for more than 10 hours a day.</p>
              <p>There are two perspectives to look at it. Either they are not efficient at finishing the work
                within the stipulated time or they are extremely good at what they do. Hence the manager prefers
                the hard worker to do the heavy lifting. The former might get fired and later might get to stay
                in the same position for years. What? Being extremely efficient is not enough to prosper? The
                fact is that the employee is more valuable to the business where he is. So how to prosper at
                work/business? Become an outlier!</p>

              <h3 class="title">Outliers</h3>
              <p>“Outliers: The Story of Success” by Malcolm Gladwell holds the some of the answers we need to
                find our drive. Malcolm analyses the success of Bill Gates and the rock band Beatles. The
                ability to gain 10,000 hours of practice at a very young age when the computers could only be
                found in universities is what led Bill Gates to success.</p>
              <p>Apart from intelligence, talent also plays a role in the success many people hold. The key point
                here is the determination and the motivation to learn is what lead Bill Gates to gain the 10,000
                hours of practice at a very young age.</p>
              <p>It takes approximately a decade to gain the practice time mentioned above. Do you have the
                determination and the drive to do what you love and stay on course for a decade to start
                becoming an outlier?</p>

                something? What is that? That’s one of the things you are really passionate about.</p>
              <p>To become truly successful never do anything just for money; do it with love. Find the career

              <h3 class="title">Desires of a Laptop Technician</h3>
              <p>In India, sometimes we do not get what we want in our lives. I always wanted to be a software
                engineer. Back in 2008, during my high school, I was really good at computer science. I would
                often solve all the problems proposed by the teacher and would always rank first in the exams.
              </p>
              <p>We were given an opportunity to choose our university degrees. I wanted to take B.E in IT and was
                pretty stern about it. My parents thought that enrolling me in B.E Electronics and
                Communications Engineering would be a better option! Yes! Such things happen in India; I am not
                sure where else but definitely in India.</p>
              <p>My parent's arguments were that choosing ECE would broaden my horizons and possibilities of
                landing  at a lucrative job after graduation. They were right. I was offered a job at Cognizant
                Technology Solutions. It was a dream for me. I always wanted to work for CTS and was planning on
                joining it. I thought my life was settled. An uncle of mine is working for CTS for the past 16
                years. Who could ask for something more right? I did.</p>
              <p>After getting an offer letter from CTS which I was eagerly waiting for since my first year in
                college and after attaining the goal, the fun was finally over. I wanted more; so I applied for
                masters in the UK and got that too.</p>
              <p>Why did I apply? I wanted to see the other end of the world and know what’s out there! The
                initial visa for the education in the UK is one year and four months. I loved the change in the
                culture and the freedom which the UK had offered. By all means, I considered myself a successful
                graduate.  All of my friends except a handful have flunked and have returned to their home
                countries.</p>
              <p>My visa was due to expire in the next few months. I wanted more of UK; so I applied for an MBA
                course in London; I had no intention of completing it. It was supposed to provide me with enough
                time to search for a job in the UK. Meanwhile I got a fulltime job as a laptop technician in
                Coventry.</p>
              <p>Staying in the UK and experiencing the newly obtained freedom had obstructed my vision
                spectacularly. I wasted more than 8 months searching for a job while also being a laptop
                technician.</p>
              <p>I had all the right intentions to do my best as a laptop technician in Coventry but my heart was
                always towards obtaining a corporate job as a control systems engineer or better a software
                engineer.</p>
              <p>This prevented me from being the best expression of myself as a laptop technician. Even though I
                thought I was doing the best, I could hardly satisfy the owner. During the six months, I topped
                up once to a wrong number for a customer costing the company £20.</p>
              <p>To put it into perspective, it was half of my daily income, then. I proved to be an expensive
                bargain for the mobile shop. So, they had to let me go after 6 months. I truly felt that I was
                not worthy of obtaining a corporate job. If I cannot work and satisfy a mobile shop owner, how
                could I truly satisfy a multinational company?</p>
              <p>Later, I was offered another Graduate Software Engineer job in Kings Lynn. Just what I wanted.
                So, I borrowed a total sum of £1500 from my parents to migrate from Coventry to Kings Lynn.</p>
              <p>Life suddenly became colorful. I was motivated to do whatever best I could do and to be my best.
                For the first few months, the company wanted me to be in the production line, actually
                manufacturing the product.</p>
              <p>I gladly accepted it. All, I wanted was a job and honestly if I can be a graduate software
                engineer it did not matter. They knew very well that I just graduated from the university and
                did not have any experience as a software engineer.</p>
              <p>I proved to be too expensive for the company as the company could hire the same talent for 30%
                less salary. The UK would not allow me to be hired for such a low salary as it is a prerequisite
                to obtain my visa. So, I had to be let go off!</p>
              <p>“Don’t ask me, didn’t the company already know?” I was either too naive or they utilized me big
                time. I paid for the visa; I paid for migrating the house. Honestly, they had nothing to lose.
              </p>
              <p>“I got fired again! Wow! I am truly unworthy”. I convinced myself that the UK did not want me
                there. So, I had booked a one-way ticket to India. I did not want to waste another 8 months
                looking for a job and waste my parent's money.</p>
              <p>After finding a job in India, I wanted to be valuable to the organization. The company took me as
                an unpaid intern. So, I learned different programming languages during my training. Finally, I
                thought of myself as worthy of working in a software industry since I was starting to get ahold
                of what programming actually is. Just then, the company with which I was working became bankrupt
                and everyone in the company was let go!</p>
              <p>Fantastic! The world is conspiring against me. Why can’t I hold a job for more than a year?</p>
              <p>Lessons learned so far: </p>
              <p><strong>If you work for a company just for money, you will never be able to be the best expression of
                  yourself</strong>. You will be fired for underperformance. You will also be unhappy while working
                there.</p>
              <p><strong>If you are overpaid for your underperformance, you will become too expensive for the
                  company</strong> and they would have to let you go; even if it is the only job which you wanted
                all your life. Unless you are valuable and be more valuable than what they are actually paying
                you. You are not worthy!</p>
              <p><strong>Even after you become valuable, the world could conspire against you</strong> and throw you to
                trash. Don't think the world has ended!</p>
              <p>All these were the best things that could ever have happened to me. They were the most valuable
                lessons which life could teach me.</p>
              <p>If I am not worthy, no company would keep me there. I would be fired immediately. So, I
                constantly strive to learn and be on top of all the technologies.</p>
              <p>I always ensure that my manager is happy with my performance and strive to improve and deliver
                better.</p>
