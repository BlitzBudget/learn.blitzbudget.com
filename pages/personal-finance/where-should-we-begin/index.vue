                But to be financially successful where do we start from? Let’s find out, Which statement resonates with
                you?

                  I am already doing whatever it takes but could barely get through life.

                <li>
                  I live a darn good life and don’t want to think about financial success.
                </li>
                <li>I have a million dollars! A billion dollars! Invested in a long-term passive income stream yielding

                Our limiting beliefs demotivate us from achieving, Our ego doesn’t let us accept the reality, find out
                where you are now and accept the facts. Now it is time to take action. Why don’t we begin with simple
                actionable steps?. Let’s see.
                <br />
                <br />
                Definitiveness of Purpose
                <br />
                <br />
                If there is one thing that you could adopt from this book it would be this.You need a definite purpose
                for every goal; without a purpose we will be like a boat drifting along the sea without a destination.
                Why do you want to be financially successful? What is the drive that motivates you to take action? Don’t
                have a definite drive to motivate yourself to take action? “Find your drive! ”

              <p>
                The story that you build around the motive to be financially successful is what is driving you to
                achieve and if you build a strong enough story that you constantly keep thinking about, it is one step
                closer to achieving success.Everyone would love to be financially successful. What is it that sets the
                ones who actually achieve financial success apart? Often the financial success is a byproduct of a
                successful career or business. The career success or business success is a by-product of opportunity and
                preparation. Don’t ever subscribe to the thought that it is pure luck. The preparation is a by-product
                of motivation and perseverance. Motivation and Perseverance are derived from reason. The reason is
                derived from the story you tell yourself.

              <p>What is your story? Do you want to be financially successful because you wanted to be significant in
                life? Do you want money to grow to provide food and shelter for your family? As Tony Robbins in “Awaken
                The Giant Within” put it – “Everything that we do, we do for a reason. Everything we do is due to a need
                to avoid pain or to gain pleasure”.</p>

                With purpose sternly in place, what is the plan that you have right now that will move you towards the
                financial success dream? The natural outcome of definiteness of purpose is motivation and passion to
                achieve the dream. Utilize the motivation to plan the path which you would love to take. People are
                their best expression of themselves when they do what they love. It is extremely hard to be successful
                at what you do when you hate what you are doing. <br />
                Learn to love what you are doing. Become extremely good at it, better than anyone else in your field.
                Have the confidence to acknowledge the dream.

              <h3 class="title">Overcoming Myopia:</h3>
              <p>
                How could my myopia have anything to do with personal financial freedom? It doesn’t. However, it has got
                everything to do with purpose, planning, taking action and being disciplined.
                <br />
                A young dumb and 18-year old version of me thought “Studying in less light might make my eyes stronger”.
                Continuing to do so for about a year, I found out that I could no longer see the blackboard in the
                classroom.
              </p>
              <p>
                I can vividly remember the terrifying experience of no longer being able to see clearly. I reported that
                to my class teacher, who suggested me to wear glasses. Without a doubt, I was diagnosed with myopia
                -0.75 in my right eye and -1.00 in my left eye way back in 2008.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fast forward to 2016, I have a -1.75 in the right eye and -2.00 in the left eye. Up until then, I was
                cool with wearing glasses and identified myself as a person wearing glasses.
              </p>
              <p>
                I remember reading the book, “Spontaneous evolution: our positive future” by Bruce Lipton and had a
                revelation for the first time in my life. I knew something was wrong with wearing glasses. If I had a
                fever, Doctor would prescribe some medicine and the fever would go away in a few days.
              </p>
              <p>
                Why doesn’t the same happen to myopia? I thought maybe glasses were contributing to the increase in
                myopia. To my surprise, I found some websites like endmyopia which motivated people to remove their
                glasses if they have a low prescription.
              </p>
              <p>
                What was the downside? It takes years to reverse myopia, Luckily, I had developed myopia during my
                teenage and not previously. If I had developed it in my childhood, my eyeballs would have grown to
                accommodate for the spectacle power.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, I removed my specs for the first time in my life on March 27, 2017
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><em>Motivation</em> - To reverse myopia and to be independent of glasses</li>
                <li><em>Purpose</em> - I know wearing spectacles is being dependant on it forever, For some reason, I
                  also felt having such a dependency would be a hurdle to propel me forward in my career path. I
                  believed it strongly (I realize Sundar Pichai wears specs).</li>
                <li><em>Plan</em> - Remove the specs, Try to relax my eyes as much as possible and never wear it again.
                </li>
                <li><em>Discipline</em> - I never wore it again. Full stop.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                As of July 30, 2018, my myopia has reduced from the previous -1.75 right eye and -2 left eye to -0.5
                right eye and -1 left eye (Clinically Tested). A clear victory against progressing myopia. I am
                expecting to have myopia eliminated by 2020.
              </p>
              <p>
                If I had never imagined that wearing spectacles would make me look a little more dependent than others
                who do not wear spectacles, I would never have done this experiment in the first place.
