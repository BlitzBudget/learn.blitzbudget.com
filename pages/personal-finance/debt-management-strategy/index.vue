              <p>Debt management requires your utmost commitment to get rid of debt. The first step in making sure
                that you start reducing your debt is an emergency fund.</p>
              <p>You need to accumulate six months of your income as an emergency fund before venturing into debt
                repayments. You do not know what is going to happen the next month.</p>
              <p>Make sure that you are covered for your emergencies. After you have 6 months of your emergency
                fund accumulated, cut your credit card. You do not need them.</p>
              <p>All the excuses for having a credit card is to cover for emergencies. Stop accumulating more
                debts.</p>
              <p>Saving 30% of your salary as emergency fund will take you 18 months to accumulate the 6 months
                income as an emergency fund. So, start saving soon.</p>
              <p>Find 30% of your income. Start earning more money by opening up multiple streams of income. Just
                find them! Always pay your default debt payments.</p>
              <p>I realize that you are in debt because of the lack of money. If you want to break this cycle, you
                need to find more money / save more money by cutting down your expenses. That’s the only way
                out.</p>
              <p>Start taking control of your finances. Anyone in debt is either earning too little or spending
                too much. Which category are you in?</p>
              <p>Spend only the bare minimum towards food, travel, school fees, insurance, debt repayments, house
                rent and save the rest.</p>
              <p>If you cannot afford to have kids, don’t have them till you increase your income.</p>
              <p>If you are like me, saving 6 months of your income as emergency fund will give you a sense of
                security. A deep satisfaction for starters.</p>
              <p>Use that to repay all your debts. Start by segregating all the debts in terms of how long it
                takes for you to repay.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Short Term Debt is any debt which is paid within the next 5 years.</li>
                <li>Mid Term Debt is repaid within 5 - 15 years from today.</li>
                <li>Long term Debt is any debt which takes more than 15 years to repay.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Now, where does your 30% of savings go after accumulating 6 months of your income as an emergency
                fund?</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Pay your short term debt first. They are the debts for which you pay maximum interest rates.
                  Finish it off ASAP.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Now, after finishing off your short term debts, you must have liberated more cash. I.e. Your cash
                which you were repaying your short term debt + 30% of your income.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Use this cash flow to repay your mid term debts. Finish them off.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Now, after finishing off your mid term debts, you must have a better cash flow than ever before.
                Your short term debts payments which you were repaying + your mid term debt payments which you
                were paying + 30% of your income.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Use this cash flow to repay all of your long term debts except your home mortgage.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Make sure that you call your bank every single time you are repaying extra to ensure that the
                extra cash goes into the principal repayment.</p>
              <p>Banks have the bad habit of not doing that. It is better to always ensure this and if you hold a
                debt and want to reduce the interest charged, some countries have the option to transfer all the
                debt to another company which offers to provide lesser interest rates.</p>
              <p>If your country has that option, make sure that you make the most use of this option. Call your
                credit card company to ensure that they reduce your interests on the debt or you want to move
                all your debts to another company which has a reduced interest rate for your credit card loan.
              </p>
              <p>All the developed nations have the option to transfer all your credit card balance to another
                credit card company at 0% interest rates. Make sure, you do not stack more debts as they will be
                charged at standard rate rather than 0%.</p>
              <p>This option of credit card balance transfer is available in India as well. There is a restraint
                though. You need to stay in one credit card company for at least a year before you can transfer
                your credit card debts and the credit card balance transfer is particularly beneficial if you
                find a bank which is willing to take the credit balance at 0%.</p>
              <p>So, after repaying all of your debts. Make sure that you invest your new cash flow into your
                investment strategy. This strategy could take you anywhere between 6 months to about 10 years to
                repay all of your debts.</p>
              <p>The repayment period highly depends on how deep are you in debt.</p>
              <p>For example, if you only have credit card debts, you could easily repay them by first transfering
                all your debt to a 0% interest account and repaying the credit balance ASAP.</p>
