              <p>You must have come across a recent study which suggests that you must have saved twice your
                annual salary before you reach the age of 35 in order to ensure that you retire by 67 having to
                live a similar lifestyle afterward. As many agree and as many disagree, The fact still remains
                the same.</p>
              <p>We start earning when we are about 25 and by the time we have reached 10 years of our working
                life, it is only reasonable to expect that one has saved about 2 years of one’s annual salary.
              </p>
              <p>A minimum of one in three persons could expect to live till their 80’s which requires a minimum
                of 13 years after his retirement to be sponsored by the 30 + years of his working life.</p>
              <p>Having said that, it is only fair to expect that you have at least 2 years of your annual income
                as savings/investment by the time you reach 35 (assuming you have a private pension).</p>
              <p>How do we achieve that figure?</p>
              <p>Let’s take for example: That you take 10% of your income and invest in Apple Stocks from the
                start of 2008 till now (2018).</p><img class="article-image"
                v-lazy="'/img/personal-finance/apple-stocks-graph.jpg'" alt="">
              <p>The table below explains how you could have saved up to 3.6 times your annual income assuming
                that your salary is $35,000 and that you save $300 every month.</p>

              <h3 class="title">Being Paid for your Value</h3>
              <p>Negotiating your salary is a conversational skill which can be improved.</p>
              <p>The sooner you get paid more the better it is.</p>
              <p>Earning more soon will directly impact your possibility of a happy retirement. The initial 10
                years of your growth and savings contribute up to 4 -12 years of your retirement if invested on
                a proper vessel.</p>
              <p>However, the later investments have the potential to compensate 2-6 years of your retirement
                assuming all the savings are 10% and are invested in a growing stock/index fund.</p>
              <p>Not having your salary rise now could cost you up to 4 – 12 years of your retirement savings,
                That’s an unbelievably high amount for a small 5 – 10% rise. All thanks to the power of
                compounding.</p>
              <p>No one is born with an inbuilt talent to negotiate. It is a skill which is developed as you keep
                practicing.</p>
              <p>The more you practice your skills on negotiation, the better the chances you have at not chasing
                your payment on bills down the line.</p>
              <p>Inform your intention of getting a raise to your boss. Chances are that he has to discuss them
                with other colleagues in your company. Inform your boss well in advance, tell them how you have
                brought value to the company while being a team player and how excited are you about the work
                you do in the same organization.</p>
              <p>While getting a raise do not just think about raising your base salary, think about the
                possibility of including stock compensation, vacation days, insurance, tax-free benefits and
                other possibilities while negotiating.</p>

              <p>It is mandatory to have a full roadmap of your personal financial life before you turn 35.</p>
              <p>The financial plan would include your short-term goals, mid-term goals and long-term goals. It
                serves as a way of measuring your goals vis a vis  where you are right now.</p>
              <p>Without a proper measuring tool (your Personal Financial Roadmap), you will be lost.</p>
              <p>Do you know anybody who was lost in a forest? Ask them what happened. It is most likely that it
                was next to impossible to get out of it without having a proper plan which includes measuring
                something (Sun/Stars).</p>
              <p>They generally walk in circles only to find out that they have walked back to where they have
                started.</p>
              <p>This exact scenario is true in personal financial life as well. If you do not have a proper

              <p>We are sure that you would have ended up in a financially daunting situation in 10 + years of
                your work life like a shortage of money, your getting fired or staying jobless for a month or
                two.</p>
              <p>It is only rational to believe that you should be saving a minimum of 6 months of your monthly
                salary as an emergency fund.</p>
              <p>If not, it is guaranteed that you would end up struggling a lot when things go south.</p>

              <p>By 35, you should have already started saving a portion of your salary consistently towards your
                retirement.</p>
              <p>Your initial investment between 25 years of age and 35 years of age will go a long way in
