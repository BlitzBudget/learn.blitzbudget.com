              <p> <strong>Minimum Risk and Maximum Security</strong> to me.</p>
              <p>These are the most common ways to kill your Golden Goose.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Bad investment thereby losing the capital and potential return.</li>
                <li>Secured capital and promised return but you spend your interest earned.</li>
                <li>Born poor, lived modestly, spent everything and died poor. (Never tried to make a golden
                  goose)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>There is another way to kill your golden goose before making one, without even knowing you are
                killing it “by being trapped in a cycle of creating and destroying your savings”. It renders the
                process of building your golden goose useless.</p>

              <h3 class="title">Burden of Debt</h3>
              <p>I have seen a lot of people who are never too serious about their goals in life. If you are not
                serious about your intentions and what you would like to do with your money, no other being will
                give a serious thought about it.</p>
              <p>Everybody dreams of buying a new home but how many ever see it to the completion without ever
                having to get a bank loan?</p>
              <p>Why is housing loan bad anyway? Ask yourself: What is the probability of your not going through a
                crisis in the period that you are repaying the loan? (10 years, 15 years or 25 years)</p>
              <p>For me, the possibility of experiencing a financial crisis in a 25 year period is 100%.</p>

                  Income”</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>It is going to be really hard to shake the home loan off once you take it.</p>
              <p>Everyone is attached to their home. We see it as our home. It’s a pride of possession to be
                possessive about. But is it really yours when somebody can take it away from you if you do not
                pay them for a certain amount of time?</p>
              <p>I am here promoting that the debt is unnecessary for anybody but what the heck will the economy
                do without a debt?</p>
              <p>The whole system relies on DEBT. If there is no DEBT, there is no money in the system to
                circulate.</p>
              <p>Have you watched the video about how the economic money machine works?</p>

              <p>Have you ever felt that however hard that you try to save in order to build your golden goose it
                becomes much more futile?</p>
              <p>If you have not, then you are the lucky few whose life is nurtured the right way.</p>
              <p>Chances are that some circumstances or people in your life are sucking the golden goose dry as
                soon as you make them. Whom to blame? You are to blame. Yes!</p>

                <p class="blockquote blockquote-success">“If you are born poor it’s not your mistake; but if you

              <p>The choices that we make in our life have a pattern. We all have our preferences in life. The
                pattern in life can be consciously made or it may be a habit which we obtain from our parents,
                loved ones or whomever we spent the most time with.</p>
              <p>Bad habits, i.e. the habits that are detrimental to our financial and personal life seep into our
                lives if we are not too bothered about whom we spend the most time with.</p>
              <p>It will be hard to shake off the habit once it becomes a part of your identity. People start
                expecting it from you and you find some pleasure in doing it.</p>
              <p>Maybe it’s your loved ones who are draining your Golden goose dry.</p>
              <p>Analyse who has the power to sap the golden goose dry. Make sure they are synergising with you
                and that you both are on the same page.</p>
              <p>It’s of no use if one is trying to build a home while the other person is trying to use the same
                pool of resource for something else.</p>

              <h3 class="title">Destruction in Disguise</h3>
              <p>Have you ever meant to help someone in money trouble by lending them some amount of money and
                ended up losing the relationship and the money?</p>
              <p>Even the right intention can be a wrong decision if money is involved.</p>
              <p>The questions to ask yourself when someone is borrowing money from you are:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Does he have a current income source from which he could easily repay the amount in the time
                  frame that he has promised to repay?</li>
                <li>Does the person have the intention to repay?</li>
                <li>Where does the money go? Is he borrowing it to consume or produce?</li>
                <li>What is the immediate crisis which makes the money necessary?</li>
              </ul>
              <p>How could you be polite while saying “no” to the lending? Saying “NO” to lending at dire moments
                in life can be disastrous to the relationship if done at the wrong time and in the wrong
                situation.</p>
              <p>Friends and Family are there to help each other in times of hardship and struggle both
                emotionally and financially if necessary. But lending too much money at the wrong time to the
                right person for them to consume an unnecessary merchandise which will add no value to the
                borrower will have repercussions if the borrower does not have the intention/income to repay the
                borrowed sum of money.</p>
              <p>Another question to ask is: Which is the source of money?</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Is it from your emergency fund?</li>
                <li>Is it from your golden goose?</li>
              </ul>
              <p>It is not too much money if the money lent can be generated by you in a few months.</p>
              <p>If you are lending from your emergency fund, you are essentially losing your security of
                emergency fund temporarily to support your friend/family in need.</p>
              <p>Of course, you earn the trust and reliability from your friend/family. But are they the kind of
                persons who keep up their end of the bargain?</p>

              <p>Have you ever noticed that some people are always in the state of emergency, always facing
                mishaps in life? They are always a few hundred dollars short every month.</p>
              <p>I personally know a handful of persons who are always short on money; but why?</p>
              <p>They care the least about money. I have asked them why are you least bothered about money? You
                know what they say?</p>
              <p>“Money comes; money parts. But relationships are for fostering and nurturing.”</p>
              <p>Well, I say “misery loves company”. These people will stay broke and long to stay broke together.
              </p>
              <p>They are getting exactly what they bargained in life. They are trading money for the comfort of
                staying broke with their friends/relatives.</p>

              <p>One feels at home when people who have the same mindset get together. You never want to leave
                them ever. They become your best friends and next of kin.</p>
              <p>That’s a comfort circle someone is building for themselves. Inside that zone, everyone stays the
                same and on par. If someone steps up, he is either pulled down or has the necessity to pull the
                circle to the new level which he has reached or leave the comfort zone which he was a part of
                and start a new life.</p>

              <p>It requires a good amount of vision and perseverance to achieve something in life. Life is going
                to be hard. You are going to lose the things you thought will be there with you for a lifetime.
              </p>
              <p>Life is unpredictable. You can control it in two ways:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>By letting fear control you and paying a premium fee to stay in your comfort zone and
                  keeping others close together without letting them fly away.</li>
                <li>Exploring the life in ways you would like to, by having a clear vision of where you are
                  going and where you would like to.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>You will be living a terribly unhappy life if you do not shape the life as you want it to be and
                by letting fear control you because “Change is the only constant in life”</p>
