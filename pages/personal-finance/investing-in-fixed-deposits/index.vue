              <p>These are one of the most common forms of investment in the developing nations, although not
                common among developed nations. These play an important role when it comes to managing emergency
                funds.</p>
              <p>They are also the least sort after forms of investments but are a good fit for emergency funds.

              <h3 class="title">Emergency Fund</h3>
              <p>Let’s get real. We may not need the 12 months worth of income to be available at our disposal all
                the time.</p>
              <p>It should be available in our bank when it is necessary and the invested money should be flexible
                enough to withdraw /redeposit or avail overdraft when ever demanded.</p>
              <p>Fixed deposits make all these possible. They are flexible enough to let you avail overdraft on
                the fixed deposit without any overdraft charges for 3 months or more.</p>
              <p>In most cases, the fixed deposits can be withdrawn immediately with about 1% penalty on the
                interest rate.</p>
              <p>Investing $100,000 for one year with an interest rate of 7%, you will be charged 1% of the
                interest rate on premature withdrawal.</p>
              <p>$100,000 at the rate of 6% interest rate on premature withdrawal by 6 months will yield $3000 on
                half yearly compounded interest.</p>
              <p>Emergency funds need not necessarily yield nil return. Any investment with 100% security and 0%
                risk with the possibility of withdrawing the money anytime will be a perfect fit.</p>

              <h3 class="title">Catch up with Inflation</h3>
              <p>Growth is necessary for the emergency funds as it has to keep up with the inflation of the
                economy. We do not want the emergency fund to buy us a little less of something as every year
                goes by.</p>
              <p>The following table assumes an emergency fund of $100,000 under the Fixed Deposit for which the
                interest rates are compounded half yearly.</p><img class="article-header-image"
                v-lazy="'/img/personal-finance/interest-rate-compounded-half-yearly.jpg'" alt="">
              <p>As time goes by we can double the initial deposit of emergency fund if the interests are
                reinvested. As discussed in the previous chapters, you can also use the Albert Einstein’s rule
                of 72 to find out exactly how long it takes for the money to double itself.</p>
              <p>While shopping around for higher interest rates in your country, it is also mandatory to check
                the stability of the banks you are depositing them under.</p><img class="article-header-image"
                v-lazy="'/img/personal-finance/fixed-deposit-interest-rate-graph.jpg'" alt="">
              <p>The graphical representation of the growth of emergency funds in fixed deposits for its
                respective interest rates is shown in the above-mentioned chart.</p>
              <p>Lehman Brothers, a bank with a 100-year-old history became bankrupt during the housing market
                crisis bringing the whole economic system to a standstill. One of the primary factors
                influencing the stability of a bank is the number of years since inception and how big the bank
                actually is. But these cannot be reliable measures in recent years as the 2008 housing market
                crash reminded us.</p>
              <p>So it is often better to divide your fixed deposits to a minimum of 2 banks. if possible let one
                of them be a government-run bank as it gives you an added security.</p>

              <p>In such cases, the US has Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to take care of the bankruptcy of

              <p>India earlier had Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) which guarantees a

              <h3 class="title">Fixed Deposit</h3>
              <p>Fixed deposit interest rates fluctuate. It also depends on every nation and how important the
                bank plays a role in facilitating the functioning of the economy as a whole.</p>
              <p>Developed nations generally provide the least interest rates. It may fluctuate between 1% to as
                high as 5.5% in Europe, USA, and the UK.</p>
              <p>While developing nations interest rate may vary from 6% to as high as 14%.</p>
              <p>The general direction the interest rate of the fixed deposit takes when the country transforms
                from underdeveloped to developing to developed nations is generally downwards.</p>
              <p>Historically interest rates were a big attraction to open a bank account. Bank accounts were not
                mandatory and did not play an important role in the economy as it does today. Hence the primary
                motivation for any person to open a bank account would be the interest the money earns.</p>
              <p>As banks begin playing a majority role in the creation of money, it pays for the government to
                make the bank account mandatory for every transaction.</p>
              <p>As this happens, the banks lose the necessity to provide higher interest rates to attract new
                bank accounts.</p>
              <p>In order to control the flow and the general direction of the economy, interest rates are decided
                by centralized banks. The central banks play a role in motivating people to either take a loan
                or to start saving by varying the interest rates.</p>
              <p>In 2008, interest rates in majority of the developed nations fell to a rock bottom. As people
                lose the motivation to take a loan, the money in the economic system starts to dwindle. People
                stop paying loans and as a result, money disappears from the system.</p>
              <p>To prevent this from happening the central bank varies the interest rate to stimulate the economy
                and provide price stability but during the economic crisis under extreme conditions, the central
                banks run out of ways to stimulate the economy and the government steps in.</p>
              <p>The governments can pump money into the system by providing it to banks/businesses. That way the
                money seeps into the economy and keeps the money flowing.</p>
              <p>When all of the tricks fail, its usual that the growth in the economic system stops, deflation
                starts to kick in and job cuts become a common phenomenon.</p>
              <p>Varying interest rates is not the only way to stimulate the economy. The central banks can also
                buy back the treasury notes to pump money into the system.</p>
              <p>If the inflation stops due to the economic crisis, it is usual that the central banks would have
                already lowered the interest rates on the bank deposit. So it does not matter what the interest
                rates for fixed deposits are as it is always in close proximity to the inflation.</p>
              <p>What makes more sense is the relation between the fixed deposit interest rates and the inflation
                of the currency.</p>
              <p>This relationship is sure to stay within acceptable limits at least in the developed nations.</p>
              <p>So, it doesn’t matter if you are in a developed nation or developing nation and if there is an
                economic crisis in your country or not. Fixed deposits are the best way to ensure your emergency
                fund stays safe and earns interest at the same time while not destroying the whole purpose of
                having an emergency fund.</p>
