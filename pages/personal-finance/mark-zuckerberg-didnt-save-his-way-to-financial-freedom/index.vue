              <p>Why do people think saving is the key to wealth when the most wealthy people didn’t get to the
                top by saving?</p>
              <p>A really good question. But it lacks depth. Do you really think that a really talented could
                achieve peak wealth with the effort which he alone put? The answer is NO.</p>
              <p>We all know that even the most talented person could only reach the pinnacle of wealth with the
                help of their relatives.</p>
              <p>Let’s take Mark Zuckerberg as an example. He grew up in quite a rich family along with his 3
                sisters.</p>
              <p>We all do know that Edward Zuckerberg and Karen Kempner Zuckerberg (Parents) tried their best to
                develop the skills of their talented children. They did hire a tutor, to teach Mark about
                programming when they noticed that he was interested in programming.</p>
              <p>When Mark dropped out of Harvard ($45,958/year for tuition fees alone), his father Edward loaned
                him money to start the “Facebook”.</p>
              <p>In short, their parent did all the hard work to push their son to the top, just so that their son
                can do the remaining effort.</p>
              <p>Edward Zuckerberg was a dentist and successfully did his part of the bidding, saved enough money
                to become wealthy and make sure that their children have an advantage when they start living
                their life.</p>
              <p>You can find this to be true in most of the other successful billionaires.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Donald Trump’s Dad owned thousands of apartment in Queens and New York City (27,000
                  apartments).</li>
                <li>Bill Gates's Dad (William Henry Gates II) is a is a retired American attorney and
                  philanthropist and author of the book Showing Up for Life: Thoughts on the Gifts of a
                  Lifetime.</li>
                <li>Jeff Bezos who learned his key business skills from his grandfather (who was a very
                  successful scientist, businessman, and landowner)</li>
                <li>Warren Buffet’s father (Howard Homan Buffett) was a successful American businessman,
                  investor, and politician.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Most of the millionaires take hundreds and thousands of dollars from their parents and their
                grandparents as inheritance / borrow them to get started with their life.</p>
              <p>As a matter of fact, you need to own enough shares in your own company when it is going public
                (IPO). How will you have enough money if you are just starting out in life?</p>

              <h3 class="title">Exceptions to this rule:</h3>
              <p>You can always find exceptions to this rule.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Steve Jobs, for example, had to even step over / openly take advantage of misfortunes to
                  come to the top which happened to people like Stephen Gary Wozniak. It takes a certain grit
                  to become something from nothing. Steve had it.</li>
                <li>Jay-Z the famous rapper was a drug dealer and he agrees with it. Luck, skill and ambition to
                  achieve pushed him to make millions.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Other are not so lucky, They have to resort to plain old savings and compounding to take them one
                step above.</p>
              <p>From where your children can pick up and start building more wealth from it. If you happen to
                fall among the rest, there is only one way to get rich,</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Budget – Spend less than you earn.</li>
                <li>Save – Save the rest of the money</li>
                <li>Buy Assets – Save enough money to buy assets</li>
                <li>Optimize returns – optimize returns on your assets</li>
                <li>Repeat</li>
              </ul>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="blockquote blockquote-success">“Every penny saved is a penny
                  earned”<br /><br /><small>Benjamin Franklin</small></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Honestly, you are doing well if you manage to build on top of your family’s wealth. Just make
                sure that you do not reset yourself back to zero. It is really easy and tempting (I personally
                know a lot of ’em).</p>
              <p>If your parents have done this work for you, better start building more wealth on top of it. Keep
                building them and provide a higher nest egg to your children with which they can repeat the
                same.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, you are equally successful as Mark Zuckerberg or Warren Buffet if you convert your
                family’s $5000 net-worth to 5 million dollars.</p>
              <p>As you know, saving is not the way to create wealth for those who already have enough money to
                buy assets. Even then the general rule of thumb,</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="blockquote blockquote-success">“Buy Asset – Generate Money From It – Reinvest The
                  Money Generated To Buy More Assets”</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>In other words, Spend less than you Earn – Save – Buy more assets – Repeat.</p>

              <p>According to other sources, it might just be higher.  The rule is simple. If you do not know how
                to manage money, it is useless even if you have a million dollars in your bank account. You will
                be bankrupt at some point in your life.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, it is the people whom you surround yourself with who bring you down.</p>

              </p>
              <p>There is no use giving the money to the people who are not worth it. It might be a bit rude but
                it is the truth.</p>
              <p>It is hard to become wealthy and harder to remain wealthy What are the factors which help people
                to become and remain wealthy in the first place?</p>
              <ul>
                <li>You need people around you who push you to the stars and stay with you no matter what.</li>
                <li>You need to keep learning.</li>
                <li>You need to become a better personal financial manager.</li>
                <li>You need to get your life in order / be responsible for your life and take control of your
                  life.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>That’s just sorting out your personal life. You need to sort out the work aspect of your life as
                well.</p>
              <p>You need to be a better person every day. Continually strive for excellence. Even then there are
                external factors which could drastically affect your possibility of becoming rich. So you need
                the plain old <strong>LUCK.</strong></p>

              <p>The goal is to produce more money with the money which you saved/measure your ROI (Return on
                Investment)</p>
              <p>If you produce > 10% return on investment you are bound to multiply your invested amount 5 times
                over in a 30-year span.</p>
              <p>Remember, <strong>Einstein’s Rule of 72:</strong></p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="blockquote blockquote-success">Interest Earned x Years Required = 72</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>It is hard to not speak about the above-mentioned rule while speaking about compounding. For
                example, you want to double your money in 10 years.</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="blockquote blockquote-success">Interest Earned = 72/10 = 7.2%</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>So, you need to aim for a 7.2% interest rate in order to double your invested money in 10 years.
                It’s as simple as that.</p>
              <p>It does not matter if you fail to find a million dollar startup. With the help of compounding,
                you will definitely quadruple your money invested.</p>
              <p>For that, you need to save enough money to invest.</p>
              <p>Every financial book speaks about the rule of 72 right? There is an inherent flaw in the equation
                which nobody speak about. The equation is fairly accurate for interest rates less than 9% or for
                the number of years more than 8 years. To understand what I mean, let’s have a look at the table
                below which calculates how long it takes for a $1000 to be doubled for variable interest rates.

              <p>To reduce the error factor, I use a customized version of Einstein’s rule of 72 which I had
                developed. Let’s just call it <strong>“Improvised Rule of 72”</strong>.</p>
              <p>If you know the number of years, then use this formula:</p>

              <p>As you can see from the above table, the error margin is now ~ 57 dollars instead of a wide
                variation of about ~94 to ~ 1 dollars.</p>
              <p>This calculation could be used to reliably predict the interest rate required to double your
                wealth. If you are a person who would like to further reduce the error margin then you should
