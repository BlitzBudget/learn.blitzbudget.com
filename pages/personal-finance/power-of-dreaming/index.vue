              <h3 class="title">It all starts with a dream to become successful in life...</h3>
              <p>The dream has to be justified with a
                definiteness of purpose. The purpose then drives us to plan and to take action. Keep repeating
                the action with discipline and there you have it! A glimpse of the path to success.</p>
              <p>Assuming you are dreaming to become successful in the field that you love, you would find it
                relatively easy to learn from your mistakes. Learning from the mistakes fine tunes your skills &
                improves it to an extent that you become more and more valuable day by day.</p>

              <p>You should start attending seminars by Tony Robbins or Harv Eker. They have the habit of making
                you realize your false perceptions. They make you really uncomfortable and uncomfortable is what
                we want everybody to feel. That’s when people start taking action and start moving forward in
                life towards success.</p>
              <p>Feeling uncomfortable about your current situation is the best thing that could happen to you.

              <h3 class="title">How do you become Successful in Life</h3>
              <p>You have probably heard that you have to provide value. Value also means helping people solve a
                problem. It has to be in your area of expertise.</p>
              <p>How do you find an opportunity to solve a problem? Chris Guillebeau, Author of “$100 startup” has
                some really good insights.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Inefficiency in the market can be compensated by your product/services.</li>
                <li>The advent of new technology or opportunity. For example – Android and play store in the
                  late 2000’s.</li>
                <li>Being efficient and talented in your area of expertise.</li>
                <li>Providing customer what they want and not what you think they want.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3 class="title">Does providing Value make you successful?</h3>
              <p>No. It simply provides you with an opportunity to earn. To become successful, you should be the
                kind of person that people think about in order to resolve that problem. “Losing my virginity”
                by Richard Branson has some perfect suggestions.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Make a positive difference in people’s life. Doing good for others without expecting
                  anything in return at times is good for business.</li>
                <li>Believe in your Ideas and be the best you could possibly be in business/personal life.</li>
                <li>Have fun along the way to success and always look after your team.</li>
                <li>Never give up.</li>
                <li><strong>Active Listening</strong> - Take notes when necessary and keep facing challenges.</li>
                <li><strong>Hire Your Weaknesses</strong> – Delegate and spend more time with your family. Always listen
                  to your families opinions and then make your own decisions.</li>
                <li><strong>Go Offline</strong> – Turn Off your Laptop and iPhone before you engage with the world every
                  day. Embark on the journey of your life and experience it to the fullest.</li>
                <li><strong>Communicate, Collaborate And Then Communicate More</strong> – Always remember to convey the
                  ideas in a simplistic term.</li>
                <li><strong>Do What You Love</strong> – surround yourself with people you love and people who love you.

              <h3 class="title">The Real Price of not doing What you Love</h3>
              <p>I vividly remember the first time when one of my colleagues introduced me to the website
                wishandfly.com - an interesting concept in which the traveler pays a set amount of money, in
                this case, €150 per traveler and the traveler does not know where he/she is traveling before 48
                hours of the date of travel.</p>
              <p>The moment, I laid my eyes on it. I knew it had a great potential in India and wanted to create a
                website for exactly this purpose. I was sure that it would be a great success. There began a
                journey of surprisetours.in. It took me nearly 3 months to finish the website and that meant
                that I did not learn anything about personal finance during those three months.</p>
              <p>What next? I am in Spain, trying to run a surprise tours travel agency in India. Will it work
                out? it might. That would mean that I have to be available over the phone, provide a valid
                address, register the business, start a business account and market the website.</p>
              <p>Will I be a millionaire the next day?  Nop. I was enthusiastic about the opportunity to create
                the website but gave up on it as it was practically not viable since I was in Spain. It would
                mean that I spend a fortune to set up and start the business and most likely hire people and
                manage them remotely.</p>
              <p>I gave up on it after three months. The website is still live earning a total of ₹0 for the past
                four months. Then, I diverted my attention back to readorb.com. It is the one thing which I am
                certain that I will get back to, no matter what. I have practically experienced it.</p>
              <p>Readorb is what I love, without learning about personal finance, I am a failure in my personal
                life. It is too important to give up. While learning about personal finance, this is the way
                that I would like to give back to the community. The website and all of its contents are free.
              </p>
              <p>What’s the big deal in running a website right? It’s hardly giving back to the community. Try to
                do the same as a part-time job while also learning about personal finance. The content has to be
                a quality one else people would never visit it. There are thousands of financial websites out
                there. The last website which could be a success is Readorb and I am aware of that. Every
                business has to have its own niche. Mine is a personal financial plan for millennials and I know
                it works. How? I am a millennial myself.</p>
              <p>All the personal financial advice provided here are tried and tested. Only out of the experience.
                Paving a clear financial path and planning for it is half the job done. The other half is to
                actually execute the formulated plan.</p>
              <p>So, I gave up on surprise tours and I am back on learning about personal finance. I love learning
                about personal finance and just because there was an opportunity in India regarding surprise
                tours does not mean that I will succeed in it. Unless I love the fact of running a travel agency
                and am passionate about it, I will never be a success. In fact, I will be a failure.</p>
              <p>Lesson well learnt: <strong>Do only what you love and do it consistently.</strong></p>
