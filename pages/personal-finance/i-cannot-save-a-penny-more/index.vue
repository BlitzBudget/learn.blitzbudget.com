              <p>Why aren’t people saving?</p>
              <p>You’ll start saving money when your future needs become more important than your current desires.
              </p>
              <p>People spend on things which they do not need. One could easily avoid regular restaurant expenses
                by cooking from home. That’s the reason why people are not saving. Your current wants outweigh
                the necessity to save more for tomorrow.</p>
              <p>If you tend to be one of them, it’s time to change the perspective. Else your primitive brain
                will induce pain whenever you try to save more money. Why? Because you are putting off
                something. The pain should be replaced with pleasure. That’s the only way you will start saving
                more money.</p>
              <p>What are the ways to save more money if I cannot find a penny more to save?</p>

              <h3 class="title">Create a Budget</h3>
              <p>Create a budget, plan your budget and stick to it. Allocate money to your expenses like food,
                electricity & gas bill, home rent/mortgage, travel and miscellaneous expenses. Have a budget and
                allocate a percentage of your income towards all the categories and stick to the plan until the
                end of the month.</p>
              <p>I am pretty sure the first time you try to create a budget some of the sectors will run out of
                money. Don’t worry you will get better the next month</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="blockquote blockquote-success">“The trick to mastery is repetition.”</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The key to creating a new budget is to just start saving a $100 the first month or any amount you
                can afford for that matter and create a budget with the remaining amount. Stick to it until the
                end.</p>
              <p>Still, can’t find enough money to save? Can’t find that extra $100?</p>

              <h3 class="title">Latte Factor</h3>
              <p>Latte factor is the answer to your questions. Latte factor was first introduced by David Bach in
                his book “The Automatic Millionaire”. We can all find our Latte factors in life.</p>
              <p>All we have to do is write down all the expenses that you had for that day after reaching home.
                You will find that you grabbed a cup of coffee from Starbucks for $4 or that you have muffins
                for $4.75 every day for your breakfast. Well, that is $80 for one month if you can choose an
                alternative plan to fetch that cup of coffee. Everybody has one. There is not a single soul who
                cannot find the one thing he is spending the extra money on.</p>
              <p>Eating outside, drinking outside, the extra expense which we seduce ourselves with are all the
                excuses we make to spend the money today instead of saving them for our future.</p>

              <h3 class="title">Bring in More Money</h3>
              <p>Are you the extraordinary person who does not have any Latte factor in your life? Or not willing
                to cut back your spending but choose to find an alternative approach to saving? Find new ways of
                bringing in more money to your family. It may be an extra part-time job every weekend that you
                have to do or a passive stream of income. Every penny you add extra will go towards the saving.
              </p>
              <p>Find your savings. Plan for the future. Have a purpose to drive your income higher. Save more
                when you earn more.</p>

              <h3 class="title">Clear Cut Strategy</h3>
              <p>In the next chapter, we will be allocating a budget for you. This strategy is designed to pay
                yourself first.  All the strategy mentioned in Chapter 13: Income Allocation is currently being
                practiced by myself</p>
              <p>I can personally assure you that this budgeting strategy is extremely efficient in paying
                yourself first. I recommend to have a separate account for your savings and have a separate
                account for your spending.</p>
              <p>Transfer all the “Pay Yourself First” money automatically on the 1st of every month. Never fail
                to stop doing that as the day you stop paying yourself first will be the day you have failed to
                live up to your dream.</p>
              <p>Always! Have a “lavish spending” account which is used to fulfill your desires. This never fails
                to motivate you always to anticipate the next month.</p>
              <p>Income allocation is by far the first strategy every individual has to implement in their lives.
                If you do not measure what comes in and decide what goes out and how you will end up spending
                everything you earn.</p>
              <p>Out of your savings account goes your debt repayments except for your mortgage. It is designed
                this way for a reason which we shall discuss in Part Four: Debt Management Strategy.</p>
              <p>Your Emergency Fund and Your Savings account are one and the same. The Emergency Fund is
                deposited as Fixed Deposit in the Savings Account which you have allocated for “Pay Yourself
                First”.</p>
              <p>Your expenditure account will pay your rent/mortgage, insurance, self education expenses &
                charity expenses.</p>
              <p>You will spend the food/travel expenses in cash. It will ensure that you always have money in
                your wallet and that will be a constant reminder of your habit of budgeting.</p>
              <p>We will use the savings account later to invest periodically if necessary to attain your mid-term
                and long-term goals. So it is mandatory to have a savings account in order to begin implementing
                personal financial success habits.</p>
              <p>Have you allocated a savings account? Alright! Let's move on!</p>
