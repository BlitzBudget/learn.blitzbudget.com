              <p>Why do human beings do what they do? Why do we need to be financially free? Some of them make a
                killing. Some sacrifice their life in the hope of providing a better life for their children.
              </p>
              <p>People are pushed by needs. There are five needs which foster the desire for financial freedom.
                They are the most fundamental needs and everyone has a collection of these needs.</p>
              <p>While the first three needs are the most abundant, people often find different means to achieve
                these needs. Joining the army and putting one’s life in line for the nation or booking a whole
                IMAX theatre for $40,000 simply to prove to a person who left them seven years ago. Yes, it
                happened!</p>
              <p>Let’s have a look at the fundamental needs which foster financial freedom desires.</p>
              <p>Five fundamental needs which foster desire for financial freedom are</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Significance</li>
                <li>Growth</li>

              <h3 class="title">Significance</h3>
              <p>The significance is by far the most important need of all. People have the need to feel
                significant and having others to acknowledge that they are significant. It is the most primal
                need.</p>
              <p>Even Monkeys have them. There is always an Alpha Male in the tribe and most of the males fight
                for the position. Though we have evolved from them, these needs keep us up to date with the ever
                growing economy, improving technology and such other things.</p>

              <h3 class="title">Epitome of Financial Illiteracy</h3>
              <p>Have you ever met anyone whom you consider to be a financial illiterate?</p>
              <p>I did. Occasionally I would bring about financial topics which as you know, I love to speak
                about. I came to know that some people honestly have no interest to speak about finances and
                they delegated the task to their mom or dad.</p>
              <p>But, this particular friend of mine was interesting as their family as a whole would delegate the
                task of financial money management to one of his uncles.</p>
              <p>I was wonderstruck with this information. I had always believed that any human being is
                inherently selfish. I have never come across anyone yet who acts selflessly on such a consistent
                basis.</p>
              <p>He was confident that his uncle was managing finance of all their families forever! His uncle by
                the way has his own family, kids, wife and is working to earn his share of income which he
                spends for his family.</p>
              <p>Apart from this. He takes care of all the financial planning of my friends family. My inner
                instinct sensed something was clearly wrong!</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="blockquote blockquote-success">“Every man for himself”</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I never gave much thought to it next time and honestly, it was none of my business. My friend
                would never be bothered to know about finance. He was working with me in Spain as I recommended
                him.</p>
              <p>One fine day, I asked him how he is managing all his finances. He told me that he is taking some
                advice from his uncle and following his lead.</p>
              <p>My friend was earning as much as I was and I knew as a matter of fact that it was the first time
                that he was earning that much in his lifetime. He was only 24 years of age at that time.</p>
              <p>Curious to know more about his uncle's advice on investing, I asked him what was it that his
                uncle suggested.</p>
              <p>He said “My uncle suggested me to invest in a Chit Fund and I have been doing that since long
                before I came to Spain”</p>
              <p>I was shocked. I have never heard of it in my entire life.</p>
              <p>Later, I came to know it is a kind of savings and credit association system. It is a scheme which
                is organized by financial body or informally among friends.</p>

              <h3 class="title">How it works</h3>
              <p>Let’s assume that 10 people have gathered to organize a chit fund with an organizer. Usually, the
                organizer does not participate in the chit fund.</p>
              <p>Let’s also assume that every person has to pay a sum of ₹20,000 for 10 months. So, every person
                would be investing ₹200,000 in the chit for a period of 10 months.</p>
              <p>First month, all the 10 subscribers place their first month installment of ₹20,000 in a pot. The
                organizer then auctions the money to the 10 subscribers. Any body who bids the lowest amount
                will receive the first months sum of ₹200,000. Let’s assume that 1st subscriber has won the
                auction by bidding the lowest ₹170,000.</p>
              <p>The organizer would then hand the 1st subscriber ₹170,000 and distribute the remaining ₹30,000
                after deducting a small percentage fee as his service charge.</p>
              <p>Anyone who is too desperate for the money would bid the lowest and gain access to a lump sum
                money immediately after which they would continue paying the chit till the end of the tenure
                (i.e 9 more months).</p>
              <p>The first subscriber has invested ₹200,000 and received ₹170,000. The remaining ₹30,000 is
                considered as the premium fee for early access to the lump sum money.</p>

              <h3 class="title">Risk</h3>
              <p>He finishes explaining everything and the first thing I ask him is what happens if someone
                defaults after obtaining the lump sum money.</p>
              <p>He was participating in a 20 member chit fund for a period of 20 months and it was informal.
                Meaning, no one can do anything if the organizer/subscribers default on the payment.</p>
              <p>What is the advantage of an informal chit fund! <strong>Tax…</strong></p>
              <p>You do not have to pay any taxes on the interest rates obtained.</p>
              <p>My friend being a patient chap as he is, chose to wait till the end of the 20 month tenure to
                receive the payment from the organizer.</p>
              <p>Only after the 20 months, the organizer offered to pay him the full amount ₹400,000 in cash. My
                friend was currently in Spain and the organizer was back in India. My friend asked the organizer
                to pay a set amount by electronic transfer every month.</p>
              <p>My friend received a total payment of ₹180,000 in total and the remaining ₹260,000 is nowhere to
                be seen. He might get the money in the next few months or years or he may not.</p>
              <p>Only time knows the answer to this question. <strong>Let’s analyse this situation financially.</strong>
              </p>
              <p>He paid a total of ₹349,000 and is scheduled to receive an amount of ₹400,000. A total rate of
                return of 12.75% for a period of 20 months.</p>
              <p>What if he paid ₹20,000 every month as a recurring deposit to a bank in India. How much could he
                have earned?</p>
              <p>Paying for a period of 20 months, he would have earned a total sum of ₹424,488. A net profit of
                ₹24,488 compared to the profit he earned from chit fund which is ₹51,000.</p>
              <p>Chit fund offers a huge return, exactly 208% more than the recurring deposit as the recurring
                deposit only offers a return of 6.75% per annum.</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="blockquote blockquote-success">“Recurring Deposit is a special kind of Term Deposit
                  offered by banks in India which help people with regular incomes to deposit a fixed amount
                  every month into their Recurring Deposit account and earn interest at the rate applicable to
                  Fixed Deposits”<br /><br /><small>Wikipedia</small></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Clearly, chit fund wins. The risk of getting the money as promised relies solely on the
                dedication of the subscribers and continuous participation of the organizer.</p>
              <p>My friend clearly trusted the organizer too much and the organizer ended up spending my friends
                ₹280,000. Now, my friend is in trouble. There is no proof that the organizer owes my friend his
                ₹280,000. Incase, the organizer wishes to default on the payment, there is absolutely nothing
                which my friend could do.</p>
              <p>My friend contacted his uncle and still could not successfully retrieve all the money from the
                organizer.</p>
              <p>Second mistake my friend did was the fact that he did not know any of the subscribers nor the
                organizer. That was too much of a risk. There is not emotional or financial obligation from the
                subscriber or the organizer to keep their end of the bargain.</p>
              <p>Third mistake my friend did was delegating personal finance to his uncle who happens to have his
                own family and there by having his own separate personal financial obligations which will prove
                to be an extremely expensive mistake for my friend and his family.</p>
              <p>If he had spent the time to find his financial freedom desires, he could have deposited the money
                in the recurring deposit which is risk free thereby receiving the promised capital + interest
                earned instead of investing in a chit fund which has a higher risk.</p>
              <p>There is no use investing in a fund which provides a higher rate of return for a higher risk, as
                the risk of losing the capital invested is not tolerable in any circumstances.</p>
              <p>Taking control of your financial freedom is the key to financial success. Expecting others to
                take control of your financial life while leading you to success is just wishful thinking.</p>
              <p>Such scenarios are just a pipe dream. Your desire to attain your financial freedom has to have
                some meaning to you. It is your dream, your purpose and you should be the one attaining it. When
                it comes to personal financial success the journey itself is as important as the destination.
              </p>
              <p>The journey towards your personal financial success will teach you some life lessons which will
                be useful for a lifetime. Having said that, It is not a surprise that the lottery winners go
                bankrupt a few years after winning millions of dollars.</p>
              <p><strong>If you do not know how to save</strong> or to multiply the money with a solid reason for the
                money
                to stay with you, certainly <strong>you will end up wasting the money</strong> on things which you do
                not
                need for a ridiculous price.</p>
