              <p>Every plan, savings or budget is personalized and cannot be implemented by your neighbor. It
                won’t be the right fit for them. So is your car.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Which car should you buy? A Ferrari? A Toyota? or a Mini Cooper?</li>
                <li>Do you want it new or don’t mind if it is a few years old?</li>
                <li>Is a 2 seater enough for you? How about a 5 seater?</li>
                <li>Do you want to buy a petrol or a diesel engine?</li>
                <li>Do you usually travel long distances? Is it for driving within the city limits?</li>
              </ul>
              <p>You can personalize it even further by wanting a sunroof/convertible.</p>
              <p>The concept of buying a car the right way depends on one’s financial situation. Ask yourself
                before buying a car.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Do I already have an emergency fund in place?</li>
                <li>Are you going to pay all cash for the car?</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Both the answers to the above questions should be a yes before choosing to buy a car.</p>

              <h3 class="title">Why shouldn't you Pay for the Car with a Loan?</h3>
              <p>The minute you take the car out of the showroom the price of the car goes down by a minimum of
                30% to 50%.</p>
              <p>If you have a loan you should be paying an interest on the loan. How much is it that you are
                paying? And how long are you going to pay?</p>
              <p>For the convenience of traveling in your car is it worth paying $200 / $300 every month excluding
                fuel and parking charges?</p>
              <p>Would you rather be a little less comfortable traveling on a public transport and saving $150 to
                $250 till you have saved enough to buy a car?</p>
              <p><strong>Chances are that if you start the practice of saving the money to buy a car you will end up
                  buying a second-hand car.</strong></p>
              <p>And you will feel just as happy as buying a new car.</p>
              <p>Choose to be financially free especially when it comes to paying for depreciating assets.</p>
              <p><strong>The general rule of thumb is to save one year’s worth of income for buying a car.</strong></p>
              <p>Is that not enough? Maybe you could choose a cheaper model and settle for a second hand or better
                yet, increase your income!</p>

              <h3 class="title">Comfor And Prestige</h3>
              <p>We choose to buy a car because we want to be comfortable, not getting constrained by the time
                limits of public transport and generally wanting to save time.</p>
              <p>We will end up saving about one to a maximum of two hours every day by traveling in a car.</p>
              <p><strong>What Will You Use These Hours For?</strong></p>
              <p>Would you rather spend the time watching TV, Browsing / Cooking your tomorrow’s lunch?</p>
              <p>An average man watches TV / uses a mobile phone for over 4 hours a day.</p>
              <p>But browsing is pleasurable for us and for most of them waiting in traffic in a car is not.</p>
              <p>Would you trade $250 every month for getting enough time to browse / cook / whatever you want to
                do?</p>
              <p>That’s exactly what you are doing when you buy a car which you can’t afford instead of traveling
                in a public transport for a few years.</p>
              <p>But I am getting a car am I not?</p>
              <p>Yes. But is the car worth the money which you are paying for? It is depreciating every day, every
                time you use and every extra mile it moves.</p>
              <p>You are better off with a second-hand car with less mileage. It would do the same job and you
                would end up not spending 50% more for the same car just because it was not used before.</p>
              <p>People also buy a car for the prestige of owning it.</p>
              <p>We all would like to be treated well and the people who judge you often judge you by the
                appearances and it includes the car you drive.</p>
              <p>What is the car that fits your standard and appeases your pride?</p>
              <p>If you are from a middle class or having a rich background owning a car is a basic requirement
                and is often taken for granted.</p>
              <p>Do you earn as much and save as much?</p>
              <p>The truth is if your financial situation is bad, as in case, you go into debt for buying a
                depreciating asset and cannot repay it within the next 5 years, you don’t deserve to buy a car
                as long as it is not absolutely impossible to commute without it.</p>
