              <p>Your partner is one of the most influential people in your life. The importance of having a right
                partner in life is realized in the emotional and financial aspect of your life.</p>
              <p>With increasing equality towards women even in the developing nations, it is an eventuality that
                they will be treated equally to men around the world, a safer world where they have equal
                rights.</p>
              <p>The developing nations are the most affected by the changing gender equality, being forced to
                accept the truth.</p>
              <p>The world is becoming a safer place to live for both men and women. It is becoming a better place
                for the benefit of all of us. All the governments around the world are keen on promoting gender
                equality; so it is time for us to let them into our personal finance as well.</p>
              <p>In the quest for more knowledge and wisdom, there is no room for male chauvinism and the similar
                beliefs preventing one from reaching the best expression of oneself.</p>
              <p>So, having destroyed any room for male chauvinism to prevent one from including your partner in
                your endeavor to achieve financial freedom, we can speak about the advantages of including your
                partner.</p>

              <blockquote>
                <p class="blockquote blockquote-success">“It is necessary to stay in synchrony financially and
                  emotionally to make sure that the relationship pushes both of them to achieve”</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The financial barrier is a hard nut to crack. Everyone has one’s own priorities and wishes in
                life. After all, it is your earning and your savings; the one who is entitled is you, isn’t it?
              </p>
              <p>Who owns the relationship then? Is it you or is it she? The question is absurd, isn’t it?</p>
              <p>If you are in a relationship, it is equally taking part in it that makes it a relationship. Else
                I guess you can call it dictatorship.</p>
              <p>If you both equally love each other and trust that the bond will be lasting, it will not be hard
                to include the other half in your financial situation.</p>
              <p>If you cannot trust them with your finance, don’t trust them in the first place; why did you get
                married?</p>
              <p>There is no room for selfishness in a relationship. If you have a child together, who owns the
                child? The child owns himself/herself.</p>
              <p>You both play a role in shaping the child. You own nothing! Nothing except for the love that you
                share with your child and having the other half loving your child equally, as your child is
                equally hers.</p>
              <p>You could create a financial situation from which you both could enjoy the benefits as long as
                you live and pass it on to your child after you are history.</p>

              <h3 class="title">Individualism</h3>
              <p>What is the point of living for yourself when the whole society is designed on how useful you are
                to others?</p>
              <p>Do you want to pay for everything with money? Everybody in this society even your partner wants
                your money; don’t they?</p>
              <p>They will only want it as long as you say it is yours. When you develop a habit of sharing in
                your relationship, it is no longer yours but ours.</p>
              <p>All these make sense when you are creating a stable financial situation together from scratch.
                But life is not always like that; Is it?</p>
              <p>You have a legacy. You also bring your inheritance from your parents and their parents when you
                are marrying someone and getting into a long-term relationship.</p>
              <p>What do you do with it as it is only yours? We have Prenups for that!</p>

              <h3 class="title">Prenup</h3>
              <p>If you are already in a financially stable position when you meet your partner then it makes
                sense to get a prenup.</p>
              <p>Even after getting a prenup, the society and the law can decide to throw the prenup out of the
                door and take the other partner's side.</p>
              <p>These circumstances are becoming increasingly common as the divorce rates are increasing at a
                phenomenal rate.</p>
              <p>This situation will put your financial situation in jeopardy. Better start the relationship
                thinking everything is ours so you won’t have a financial and emotional shock if your partner
                decides to leave you.</p>
              <p>For a good number of people, money governs their relationship, themselves and everything they do.
                These people are the ones that often break the relationships for money. They are also called
                Gold Diggers. It is relatively easy to find the gold diggers when you are an emotionally
                intelligent person.</p>
              <p>Be a good judge of character. Spend time to nurture your relationship. Share the happiness.
                Experience life together.</p>
              <p>If you cannot trust your partner with half of your finances, you are bound to live a stressful
                life.</p>

              <h3 class="title">One Build; The other Destroys</h3>
              <p>If you are already in a relationship where one has a surplus of money and the other is short on
                money, it is not uncommon to find one of them on a spending spree while the other tries to
                accumulate money.</p>
              <p>A collaborative effort can take advantage of synergy and yield many times the result one could
                imagine achieving alone.</p>
              <p>When you make the other person responsible for your money, they take pride in the ownership and
                try to preserve the current financial state.</p>
              <p>Make sure you and your partner are on the same page when it comes to what you would like to do
                with the money that you both choose to save.</p>
              <p>There is always an underlying reason when your partner is least bothered about the importance of
                saving. Convey how important it is for both of you to be secure financially and that relying
                solely on consumerism and borrowing for joy is a game which is bound to lead both of you to
                misery.</p>
              <p>Start producing something together and find joy in generating money rather than consuming it.
                There are CEOs worth million dollars who have never borrowed a penny but own 100% of the
                company.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>As life goes on, it either improves the relationship by building on trust or destroys the
                relationship. If you keep at it for long enough, you will either have an unbreakable trust or a
                broken marriage.</p>

              <h3 class="title">Divorce</h3>
              <p>Divorce could be the single worst thing that could happen to anybody both emotionally and
                financially.</p>
              <p>It usually happens in the 40’s and 50’s due to the mid-life crisis or happens as soon as you are
                married i.e within the first 5 years.</p>
              <p>When it happens within the first 5 years, it would be easy to come out of it as you would just
                have started to build a life for yourself. But if it happens in your late 40’s or 50’s, that is
                often the time when you would have built a solid financial base for yourself and have a strong
                relationship with your children. It would take a turn for the worse.</p>
              <p>Even having a prenup would be of no use at times. During a divorce, your money is no longer yours
                to control. The state decides what to do with your money; how much of it goes where and who gets
                to see the children, when and for how long.</p>
              <p>Divorce is when you realize even your children are not yours to see when you deem fit. Lives are
                destroyed when there is a divorce. People end up with their life savings wiped and all their
                pensions vanished.</p>
              <p>It’s the worst nightmare that could happen at the worst time. You will no longer have the
                strength to make that kind of money and will soon be rendered unfit to work.</p>

              <h3 class="title">The Financial Conversation</h3>
              <p>Remember the girl who trusted me with £7000. I ended up marrying her. It was the best thing that
                ever happened to me.</p>
              <p>By that time, I had disappointed her in money management so much that she had started managing
                her money for almost a year.</p>
              <p>Now, I wanted to make sure that we had a single financial goal and plan after being motivated by
                reading the book “Think Big and Kick Ass” by Bill Zanker & Donald Trump.  Except that, she would
                not agree to it. It was the most difficult conversation we have ever had. We had to set up
                ground rules.</p>
              <p>What could be worse? We had all these conversations over the phone. I was in Spain and she was in
                India. We were engaged by then and were about to get married in three months.</p>
              <p>It has been a year and a half after marriage. I have lived up to my expectations. It is a promise
                for a lifetime. Still, have a lifetime left to live up to my expectations. I am sure that I will
                fail again.</p>
              <p>As long as we are on the same page, we can still crawl out of any dire financial situations
                together.</p>
