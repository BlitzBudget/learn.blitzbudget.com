              <p>How much are you in debt? You need to analyze the past. If you are in debt make sure you do not
                stack up anymore. That’s half the battle against debt won! The need to stop stalking up more
                debt has to come from within.</p>

              <h3 class="title">Credit Card Debt</h3>
              <p>How many credit cards do you have? And how much do you owe to the credit card companies? Credit
                cards are meant to be short-term debts and it was never meant to be paid off over a year, God
                forbid for a decade. Do you know how much you are paying as an interest on that credit? It is
                close to 18%. That’s 20 dollars for every 100 dollars you borrow.</p>
              <p>Credit card companies flock to provide one for every person out there. They want you to buy
                something from credit card and hopefully not repay it immediately. If you do then you are not
                making any money for the credit card companies. This is often the first debt to repay.</p>

              <h3 class="title">Education Loan</h3>
              <p><strong>Young and In Debt</strong> – people who are in debt due to educational loan should aim for
                financial security by clearing off the loan. Education loan is the single largest loan repayment
                apart from the home loan for every individual out there. Most of them are in debt till their
                neck. The second loan that has to be repaid is the educational loan. There is a sense of freedom
                and achievement while repaying every loan that we ever took.</p>
              <p>People take $40,000 in loan and choose to repay it for the next 15 years in installments. Have
                you ever calculated how much are you paying by the end of the repayment tenure? It will cost 2
                to 2 and half times the original amount if the loan is taken over 15 years or more.</p>
              <p>Indian banks provide an opportunity to borrow for a period of 15 years while starting your
                repayment after you complete your studies without any cap but needs a collateral to be
                submitted.</p>
              <p>For education loans provided within the country, the maximum amount of 7.5 lakhs can be provided
                with security for a period of 8 years of repayment with a gestation period of 6 years.</p>
              <p>For example, If you borrow 4 lakh rupees without any security for an education loan and start
                repaying them after the five year gestation period with an interest rate of 12% per annum (P.A),
                you would be paying double the amount borrowed by the end of the repayment tenure.</p>

              <h3 class="title">Hoam Loan</h3>
              <p>Your financial planner, real estate agent and accountant all call your house an asset. But in
                reality, it is a liability according to the book title “Rich Dad Poor Dad” by Robert Kiyosaki.
                Although I would choose to say it is a security and not a liability. He takes a very simple
                approach. Anything that puts money in your pocket is an asset and anything that takes money away
                from your pocket is a liability.</p>
              <p>He also says that if you choose to rent your home to tenants and loose money it's a liability.
                That’s only if the money you take from the tenants is less than the money you repay to the banks
                for the home loan.</p>
              <p>If you haven’t paid for the home in full and have a loan for the home, it is an asset for the
                bank and a liability for you according to the book. Although the thought is extreme you can
                choose to take it as a security. Your home is in the security bucket.</p>

              <blockquote>
                <p class="blockquote blockquote-success">“Bad debt is a debt that makes you poor such as credit
                  card debt, car loans, and more. This is the type of debt used to buy
                  liabilities”<br /><br /><small>Robert Kiyosaki</small></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>If there is absolutely one thing that you shouldn’t take a loan to buy, it is a car. The car is
                our one deadly commodity that loses value the minute you drive it outside the store. Most cars
                lose 30% of the initial value but it could be more depending on the demand or the lack of it.
              </p>
              <p>Second-hand cars are always the best choice if you ask me as the second hands do not lose a lot
                of value when you choose to sell it. Everybody changes their car at least once in their
                lifetime. Their average lifetime of a car at the maximum is 250,000 miles. Keep that in mind the
                next time you buy a car.</p>
              <p>What is your financial position? How much have you borrowed so far? How long will it take before
                you repay the loan? What is the percentage of income that goes to your loan repayment after
                taxes? Remember you are choosing to spend your future income today by borrowing.</p>
