              <ul>
                <li>Insurance expenses are generally different from the “Pay Yourself First”, as they are a form
                  of security and also fall under expenses.</li>
                <li>It is a security as it provides you the cover if things go bad but often they don’t.</li>
                <li>Your car insurance, life insurance, medical insurances and every other sort of insurance go
                  in here.</li>
                <li>If your insurance expenses are more than the allotted budget, maybe it is time to drop a
                  handful of them or opt a reduced plan.</li>

              <h3 class="title">What's Worse?</h3>
              <p>Income allocation could be demanding at first. Honestly, what could be worse than managing your
                income?</p>
              <p>Not managing your income!</p>
              <p>What is the cost of not managing your income? Millions!</p>
              <p>Let me tell you a real-life story of a man who inherited fifteen acres of land and two three
                bedroom houses when he turned twenty-five.</p>
              <p>Let’s call him John. John lived with his mother when he inherited his father’s wealth. By all
                means, John’s father Jone was hardworking and a self-made millionaire. Jone had a medical
                condition induced by excessive cigarette smoking which ensured his premature death. Upon Jone’s
                death, his three male children inherited all his wealth. That brings us to John.</p>
              <p>John got married really early and inherited money from his father. He hardly had the necessity to
                learn about finance and has scarcely worked his entire life. He didn’t really needed to, as his
                inheritance would feed him and his family for a lifetime.</p>
              <p>So, he never really worked his entire life. His wife was by all means extravagant. They both
                lived a really comfortable life and never really wanted to work. So, they would sell all their
                earnings from their cardamom estate. Any farmer would know to keep a portion of their earnings
                to reinvest on that property. Apparently, John didn’t. He spent all their earnings from their
                real estate and borrowed money from a private lender to reinvest on the cardamom estate.</p>
              <p>The private lender would charge 100% interest rate on the loan amount. We call them “Kandhu
                Vatti”, meaning, private lending at a ridiculously high rate. They were known to borrow this
                money for personal extravagance as well.</p>
              <p>Could anyone survive this? No, apparently they started selling their property to pay off their
                debts and were often known to keep a small portion of their “Kandhu Vatti” remaining. God knows
                why! I guess, they just wanted to spend all the money for themselves. That could be the only
                possible explanation.</p>
              <p>To teach us to live a mindful life, my parents and relatives would quote “They once hired a car
                to travel”. It was back in the 80’s, when only the ultra-rich could afford a car and the poverty
                rate in India was close to 60%.</p>
              <p>Slowly but steadily, they lost their wealth. John also had the habit of gambling. He once went to
                jail for gambling as gambling is banned in India. He would often drink like a fish. Now, John is
                worth a total of ₹0.</p>
              <p>He is in his 70’s and is a victim of a stroke. Stroke induced by stress. What could be worse
                right? Nope, he failed to educate his children and hence some of them are determined to abstain
                from work for their entire lives.</p>
              <p>The last time I saw them was back in 2008 when they were living in their only home. I later found
                out that, they had sold that home and lent some of the money to a person whom they knew but they
                never got that back as well.</p>
              <p>John’s life is filled with tragedy. He now relies on his son who never intend to work.</p>
              <p>If there is one thing which could have changed their life, it was personal finance and budgeting.
              </p>
              <p>I also know enough tragedies to <strong>conclude that any person who is willing to work hard at an
                  early age with enough determination to succeed in life will build a strong financial base
                  for him and his family to prosper</strong>.</p>
