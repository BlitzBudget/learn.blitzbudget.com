              <p>We call it home because we live there with our loved ones; else it is a house, a real estate
                property, an asset or a liability. Your financial planner / real estate agent calls your home an
                asset. But what is the difference between an asset and a liability in the first place? Is your
                home an asset or a liability? Well, you are going to pay a rent for the house you are living in
                if you do not own that house.</p>

              <h3 class="title">Home is your Security</h3>
              <p>Home can be categorized as a security. Home is the place you live in and it offers a secure place
                to stay. What else is categorized as a security? You need a place to live, you need food to live
                and you need clothes to wear. They are the most basic necessities. So buying a home where you
                live on a loan is also security. You are going to pay rent otherwise to somebody which is worse
                than paying a mortgage payment towards a home you live in.</p>

              <h3 class="title">What is worse than Paying a Mortgage towards the Home you are living in?</h3>
              <p>Buying a home when the prices are really high and continuing to pay the mortgage until 8 years
                later when the home prices have dropped by 40 – 60%. That’s painful! A lot painful than paying a
                rent. A situation which occurred in the US during 2008 housing crisis.</p>

              <h3 class="title">Should you sell your Home?</h3>
              <p>In an ideal world, you shouldn’t sell your home. But people move from place to place and
                sometimes are forced to sell their home. So in such cases, buy a home in areas where the prices
                are really low.</p>
              <p>You make money while buying and not vice versa. If you find a good bargain while buying a home
                and are not paying a huge sum of money as transaction fees and are not buying a flexible
                interest rate on the mortgage or a mortgage for 30 years you can buy that home.</p>

              <h3 class="title">What about a House or a Real Estate?, How should you buy the properties?</h3>
              <p>Robert Kiyosaki the author of “Rich Dad Poor Dad” is certain that a house is a liability.</p>
              <p>It is a liability if you are paying to cover the expenses and you can convert it into an asset
                with the right kind of price for the real estate you are buying, with the right amount of loan
                repayment plan. We have to analyze if the place provides the appropriate income necessary for
                the repayment of the mortgage. If it does then we can buy the property from the place and make
                sure that it provides money into your pockets and not the other way around.</p>
              <p>Sometimes saving for buying a home and waiting for the prices to drop in order to explain the
                expenses and the income is the right way to move forward. For example, During the 2006 and 2007
                in US, home prices were increasing so fast that people could buy a house which was being built
                and sell it before completion for a profit. Such times will not last forever; as of 2008 the
                prices started falling; the tides changed for the worse with too many bad debts stacking up
                against the bankers; banks started failing and the government had to back them up. We all know
                how that turned out to be.</p>
              <p>Buying a home requires a lot of research and patience. It requires a minimum savings of nearly 10
                – 30% of the total value of the home, although paying the full amount is the ideal case
                scenario. Ask yourself, is this house a liability or an asset? Is the property putting money in
                my pocket or taking it away from me?</p>
